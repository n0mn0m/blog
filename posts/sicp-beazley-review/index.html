            <p>Last week I had the opportunity to attend a course by
<a href="https://www.dabeaz.com/sicp.html">David Beazley</a> on
<a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/index.html">SICP</a> (The
Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs). SICP is a book that was
first published in 1985 and has grown to have a bit of a reputation in various
circles of software engineering. The book itself explores many areas of
computer science with a language called Scheme (a lisp). For the course we
made use of  Racket and Python to explore those same concepts working
through the book with an eye to it's impact on modern language and design.</p>
<p>A quick note. This course was unlike any other I have been in so far. David is
really good at giving learners the time and space to think as he lays out
really dense material and like a tour guide provides interesting insights
about the landscape. Another great part of the class was the size and how Dave
gives people time to engage each other. Each morning we shared ideas,
experiences and other stories over breakfast before throwing ourselves into
the material breaking for lunch to contemplate what we had just built or
discovered rounded off with an afternoon coffee. Overall this was a fantastic
educational experience and I hope I get the opportunity to repeat it with
some of Dave's other courses in the future.</p>
<p>Throughout the week we engaged with various problems in the book such as
evaluation models, abstraction, symbolic data and more. Each time we
approached a problem we were encouraged to think as language designers and
implementors rather than language users. In doing so we put ourselves in a
different state approaching problem solving by extending the features of our
language. This led us to implementing object hierarchy and evaluation models,
dispatching state handling and creating custom interpreters with domain
specific features to solve problems.</p>
<p>One part of SICP book that stood out was the use of 'wishful thinking' as our
programming model. We would look at a problem (for instance a constraints issue
for assigning tenants to floors) and ask ourselves what a procedure or feature
would look like for accepting the data and solving said problem. We would then
implement this procedure and even mock calling other procedures that did not
exist yet to model what we felt like an optimal interface might look like. From
there we would build down implementing each new layer with wishful thinking.
This came in contrast to a lot of my day to day experience approaching problems
bottom up implementing low level details and data processing logic on our way
to an isolated solution. In some ways it felt similar to TDD if you mock out
all the functionality you don't have yet, but again with the top down mindset
of I want the langauge to do X for me.</p>
<p>Many other topics are covered throughout SICP. The book itself is very top down
starting with the language and going all the way down to implementing a
VM/register machine by the end of the book. Over time I may write some more
about those topics. All in all the course was incredibly interesting. The
conversations around lunch about the nature and philosophy of computing were a
lot of fun and spawned by the material being covered as well as the various
backgrounds we all had in our day to day work. You don't leave the course with a
new package or framework in your toolbelt. Instead you've examined of of the
underlying fundamentals of languages, computing and software. This equips you
with new models for thinking that will hopefully impact any future computing
that you take part in. While the material is dense I think anybody that truly
enjoys engaging with our craft would benefit from engaging with the SICP
material in this setting.</p>
<p>If anybody has questions about the course I'd be more than happy to talk about
the material. For those of you who don't know
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/dabeazllc/videos">David Beazley</a> I would
encourage you to visit his site or search his name on YouTube as he has a lot
of interesting material that encourages the learner to engage the material.</p>
