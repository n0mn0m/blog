# Tools

We all have tools we grow to love or turn to over time. Some of mine
are below. My dotfiles are available [here](https://github.com/n0mn0m/dotfiles/tree/).

While I don't always have the time I enjoy learning about and trying out
new tools, so if you have recommendations send them my way.

- human readable plain text
- emacs
- jetbrains
- git
- llvm/lldb
- ipython
- jupyter
- *nix
- docker
- sled
- sqlite
- org
