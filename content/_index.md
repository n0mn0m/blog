Hi, I'm Alexander

Student / Builder / Mentor

Over the last decade I have had the good fortune to work across
many domains with a lot of inventive individuals. I have learned a lot from
those who have spent the time to introduce me to new ideas and philosophies,
and I enjoy every opportunity I have to collaborate with others.

Day to day I work on projects at the intersection of science and software
that help us expand our understanding of the world. In my spare time
I enjoy tinkering with hardware to understand my garden, playing
music with Rachael and Maris, and story telling with friends.

If you want to chat you can [message](mailto:alexander@burningdaylight.io)
me, send a [patch](https://github.com/n0mn0m/), or you can view
my resume [here](@/docs/resume.md).
