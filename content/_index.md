Hi, I'm Alexander

Maker / Mentor / Student

Currently located in Louisville, KY USA I enjoy working on projects that
intersect with every day life.

By day I work at Samtec building systems that support our manufacturing
groups, and help software engineers grow in their skills and talents.

Previously I have worked at Elastic, Humana and Aspect on projects large
and small, shipping ML models, implementing backend orchestration systems
and launching new cloud platforms.

I obtained my BS in Computer Information Technology from Western Kentucky
University where I focused on network hardware and database technologies.
I continue to learn through a variety of platforms such as EdX, Safari
and technical publishers like No Starch and Manning.

When I am not at work I like to find opportunities to give back via open
source and my local community. I have helped develop and taught Python courses
with Code Louisville, I'm one of the co-organizers and founders of the Louisville
Hardware Happy Hour and I'm involved with organizing DerbyPy our local Python
user group. I also like to write, I'm constantly looking for something to
hack on. Lately most of my personal projects have centered on using a
variety of hardware platforms to find new ways to automate and interact
with the world around us.

Aside from the technical I am the proud father of Maris and a gardener
in the making.

or reach out at <n0mn0m@burningdaylight.io> where I enjoy chatting with
others.
