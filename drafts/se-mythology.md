Over the last few years I've had the opportunity to see how a variety of teams
and companies build software. Along with that I've kept up with the content coming
through various aggregators like hackernews and lobste.rs. One of the things that
every team has to decide is how they are going to actually build and maintain
their project. We make decisions like:

- what language to use
- how to manage dependencies
- how to generate artifacts
- how to manage artifacts
- how to instrument our project
- how to deliver our project
- how to document our project
- etc

Some of these have grown community standards, some platforms make the decision for
us, but often times these decisions are made off a mix of experience and a lot
of personal preference. Those preferences I imagine are largely impacted by the industry
of personality that has sprung up around:

- best practices
- techniques you don't know that could save your project
- pick your programming paradigm
- pick your pattern

Some of the problems with our judgement being so strongly influenced by these voices
is that they often lack key data for us to place them in our context and judge the
merit of what is being offered. Rarely do we know what didn't work, what came before,
the team composition and history, measurements used to determine if something truly
was better or more successful. Instead it's anecdata, stories told through the
lens of one reality.

This has made me more and more uncomfortable over time. So much time and effort
is spent without good data, and we churn and churn and churn. Oddly there is are
resources published back by data from sources like ACM, IEEE and ISO. These are not
perfect, but they offer stories backed with data. Maybe the findings have distilled
out to our industry over time, but I have a suspicion there is data there that
raises questions and counterfactuals to what we extrapolate from ones percieved
reality written down and shared, or spoke about at a conference.

This isn't meant to say that the advice we share and the experiences we live are
not important. They are incredibly important. Instead I mention this as something
I want to go to as a source more often, and to make sure I spend as much time
with this research as I do with articles in my RSS feed. I'm sure I'll learn
something along the way that I haven't heard before. More than that I hope to
find some research spanning groups, companies and project scopes that provides
a data analysis of the results on top of the stories of those followed.
