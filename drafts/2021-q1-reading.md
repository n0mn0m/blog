I read a lot of books throughout the year, but rarely write anything up
after finishing them. While I don't think I have enough to say about
any one book after my first read, I want to capture a sentence or two
about them to look back on, and to share with others. If I mention a book
here that you want to talk about send me a [message](mailto:alexander@burningdaylight.io).

## Q1 2021 List

- A Philosophy of Software Design
- Why we make things and why it matters
- Humankind
- Kubernetes Getting Started
- The Unix Administrators Handbook
