Recently, here on the Cloud team at Elastic we started working on building a
new service in Python 3.7. This service fetches data from a Postgres database,
transforms it, and then submits that data to another service. Like many
cloud-based services, ours runs in an orchestrated container environment where
N instances can be running at any time. Often that's a good thing, but our
service has a few critical sections where only one instance should be able to
process data. Since we are retrieving data from Postgres, we decided to go
ahead and make use of `advisory locks` to control these critical sections. In
this article I want to explain what advisory locks are, provide an
implementation, and test to verify functionality.

## Advisory locks

Postgres provides the ability to create locks that only have meaning within
the context of your application. These are
[advisory locks](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/explicit-locking.html#ADVISORY-LOCKS).
You use advisory locks to control an applicationâ€™s ability to process data.
Anytime your application is about to enter a critical path, you attempt to
acquire the lock. When you acquire the lock, you can safely continue processing.

```python
async with AdvisoryLock("gold_leader", dbconfig) as connection:
```

If it fails, then your application may retry, wait, or exit. Since this lock is
external to the application, this allows for multiple instances of the
application to run while providing safe critical path concurrency.

## Building the lock

As part of our work, we wanted to make using advisory locks easy. To do this,
we created the `PostgresAdvisoryLock` context manager. Since this is meant to
be used with `asyncio` and `asyncpg`, we control the acquisition and release of
the lock via `__aenter__` and `__aexit__`.

```python
class AdvisoryLock:
    async def __aenter__(self) -> asyncpg.connection.Connection:
        self.locked_connection = await asyncpg.connect(...)
        await self._set_lock()
        if self.got_lock:
            return self.locked_connection
        else:
            if self.locked_connection:
                await self.locked_connection.close()
            raise AdvisoryLockException

    async def __aexit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        await self._release()
```

Now this can be called like any other async context manager.

```python
async with AdvisoryLock(config, "appname") as connection:
    val = await connection.fetchrow("SELECT 1")
```

## Testing the lock

Now that the `PostgresAdvisoryLock` class is implemented, we need to test it.
To start we verify the base functionality by acquiring the lock, running a
query, and validating we can't get the lock inside the same scope. I recommend
using the `asynctest` library to help work with `asyncio` inside `unittest`.

```python
    async def test_get_results_with_lock(self):
        async with AdvisoryLock("gold_leader", dbconfig) as connection:
            val = await connection.fetchrow("SELECT 1;")
            self.assertEqual(val[0], 1)

    async def test_lock_prevents_second_lock(self):
        with self.assertRaises(AdvisoryLockException):
            async with AdvisoryLock("gold_leader", dbconfig) as connection:
                await connection.fetchrow("SELECT 1;")
                async with AdvisoryLock("gold_leader", dbconfig) as second_connection:
                    await second_connection.fetchrow("SELECT 1;")
```

Since we are going to use this to control the execution of code across many
processes, we also need to verify external process behavior. To do this we use
the `asyncio`  `subprocess.create_subprocess_exec` function to create a new
process. This process attempts to get the lock our main process already has,
and it should fail.

```python
    async def test_advisory_lock_prevents_access_from_separate_process(self):
        with self.assertRaises(AdvisoryLockException):
            async with AdvisoryLock("gold_leader", dbconfig) as connection:
                proc = await asyncio.subprocess.create_subprocess_exec(
                    sys.executable,
                    "-c",
                    executable,
                    stderr=asyncio.subprocess.PIPE,
                )
```

### Wrapping up

When we started to build our new application, we knew we would be waiting on
the network and database. Since we also had work that could happen during the
wait, we decided to use `asyncio`. Additionally we identified a critical path
where we used Postgres to achieve concurrency control. To make critical path
control easier we created a module and a series of tests. Once finished we
realized this might be helpful to others looking for the same control, or as
a reference for those learning to test with asyncio.
