# Toolset

I've been asked at different meetups and events about some of the tools I use. Whether
or not this is broadly helpful I figured I would start capturing this here. I think
the most important things to keep in mind are:

- Use the right tool for the job. What are you trying to do? What's the best way to do that.
- Mastery of a given tool takes time so be careful of switching tools frequently.

With that, I've ran the gamut of editors, shells, etc. and this is what I tend to use
for my day to day now.

 - emacs
 - jetbrains editors
 - git
 - llvm
 - gdb
 - ipython
 - jupyter
 - flavors of Unix(FreeBSD, OSX) and Linux(Ubuntu, RHEL)
 - docker
