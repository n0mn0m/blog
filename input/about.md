Hi, I'm Alexander (n0mn0m in some spaces)

Maker / Mentor / Forever a student

Currently located in Louisville, KY USA I enjoy creating and working on projects that
intersect with every day life. 


During the day I am at Humana where I help data scientist deploy models that assist
providers in understanding patient history and events.


Previously I worked at Elastic as a Senior Software Engineer at where we launched the
initial billing integrations for GCP Marketplace. Before that I was a Senior Analytics
Consultant for Aspect building solutions in the retail and airline industries.


I obtained my BS in Computer Information Technology from Western Kentucky University
where I focused on network hardware and database technologies. I continue to learn
through a variety of platforms such as EdX, Element14 and technical publishers like
No Starch and Manning.


When I am not at work I like to find opportunities to give back via open source and my 
local community. I have helped develop and teach Python courses with Code Louisville, I'm
one of the co-organizers and founders of the Louisville Hardware Happy Hour and I'm
reguarly involved with DerbyPy our local Python user group. Additionally I like to write,
contribute to OSS and I'm constantly looking for something to hack on. Lately most of my
personal projects have centered on using a variety of hardware platforms to find new ways
to automate and interact with the world around us.


Aside from the technical I am the proud father of Maris and a gardener in the making.
