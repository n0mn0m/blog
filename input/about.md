Hi, I'm Alexander ("n0mn0m")

Maker / Mentor / Forever a student

Currently located in Louisville, KY USA I enjoy creating and working on projects that
intersect with every day life. 

During the day I can be found at Samtec working to build systems that support global
manufacturing, and helping software engineers grow in their skills and talents.

Previously I have worked at Elastic, Humana and Aspect on projects large and small,
shipping ML models, implementing backend systems and launching new cloud platforms.

I obtained my BS in Computer Information Technology from Western Kentucky University
where I focused on network hardware and database technologies. I continue to learn
through a variety of platforms such as EdX, Element14 and technical publishers like
No Starch and Manning.

When I am not at work I like to find opportunities to give back via open source and my 
local community. I have helped develop and teach Python courses with Code Louisville, I'm
one of the co-organizers and founders of the Louisville Hardware Happy Hour and I'm
involved with organizing DerbyPy our local Python user group. Additionally I like to write,
contribute to OSS and I'm constantly looking for something to hack on. Lately most of my
personal projects have centered on using a variety of hardware platforms to find new ways
to automate and interact with the world around us.

Aside from the technical I am the proud father of Maris and a gardener in the making.

If you want to know more you can check out my [resume](../resume.html) or reach out
at <n0mn0m@burningdaylight.io> where I enjoy chatting with others.
