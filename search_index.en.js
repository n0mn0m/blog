This service fetches data from a Postgres database,\ntransforms it, and then submits that data to another service. Like many\ncloud-based services, ours runs in an orchestrated container environment where\nN instances can be running at any time. Often that's a good thing, but our\nservice has a few critical sections where only one instance should be able to\nprocess data. Since we are retrieving data from Postgres, we decided to go\nahead and make use of advisory locks to control these critical sections. In\nthis article I want to explain what advisory locks are, provide an\nimplementation, and test to verify functionality.\nAdvisory locks\nPostgres provides the ability to create locks that only have meaning within\nthe context of your application. These are\nadvisory locks.\nYou use advisory locks to control an application’s ability to process data.\nAnytime your application is about to enter a critical path, you attempt to\nacquire the lock. When you acquire the lock, you can safely continue processing.\nasync with AdvisoryLock(\"gold_leader\", dbconfig) as connection:\n\nIf it fails, then your application may retry, wait, or exit. Since this lock is\nexternal to the application, this allows for multiple instances of the\napplication to run while providing safe critical path concurrency.\nBuilding the lock\nAs part of our work, we wanted to make using advisory locks easy. To do this,\nwe created the PostgresAdvisoryLock context manager. Since this is meant to\nbe used with asyncio and asyncpg, we control the acquisition and release of\nthe lock via __aenter__ and __aexit__.\nclass AdvisoryLock:\n    async def __aenter__(self) -&gt; asyncpg.connection.Connection:\n        self.locked_connection = await asyncpg.connect(...)\n        await self._set_lock()\n        if self.got_lock:\n            return self.locked_connection\n        else:\n            if self.locked_connection:\n                await self.locked_connection.close()\n            raise AdvisoryLockException\n\n    async def __aexit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):\n        await self._release()\n\nNow this can be called like any other async context manager.\nasync with AdvisoryLock(config, \"appname\") as connection:\n    val = await connection.fetchrow(\"SELECT 1\")\nTesting the lock\nNow that the PostgresAdvisoryLock class is implemented, we need to test it.\nTo start we verify the base functionality by acquiring the lock, running a\nquery, and validating we can't get the lock inside the same scope. I recommend\nusing the asynctest library to help work with asyncio inside unittest.\n    async def test_get_results_with_lock(self):\n        async with AdvisoryLock(\"gold_leader\", dbconfig) as connection:\n            val = await connection.fetchrow(\"SELECT 1;\")\n            self.assertEqual(val[0], 1)\n\n    async def test_lock_prevents_second_lock(self):\n        with self.assertRaises(AdvisoryLockException):\n            async with AdvisoryLock(\"gold_leader\", dbconfig) as connection:\n                await connection.fetchrow(\"SELECT 1;\")\n                async with AdvisoryLock(\"gold_leader\", dbconfig) as second_connection:\n                    await second_connection.fetchrow(\"SELECT 1;\")\n\nSince we are going to use this to control the execution of code across many\nprocesses, we also need to verify external process behavior. To do this we use\nthe asyncio  subprocess.create_subprocess_exec function to create a new\nprocess. This process attempts to get the lock our main process already has,\nand it should fail.\n    async def test_advisory_lock_prevents_access_from_separate_process(self):\n        with self.assertRaises(AdvisoryLockException):\n            async with AdvisoryLock(\"gold_leader\", dbconfig) as connection:\n                proc = await asyncio.subprocess.create_subprocess_exec(\n                    sys.executable,\n                    \"-c\",\n                    executable,\n                    stderr=asyncio.subprocess.PIPE,\n                )\nWrapping up\nWhen we started to build our new application, we knew we would be waiting on\nthe network and database. Since we also had work that could happen during the\nwait, we decided to use asyncio. Additionally we identified a critical path\nwhere we used Postgres to achieve concurrency control. To make critical path\ncontrol easier we created a module and a series of tests. Once finished we\nrealized this might be helpful to others looking for the same control, or as\na reference for those learning to test with asyncio.\nYou can find the full implementation and Docker setup\non Sourcehut.\n","id":"https://burningdaylight.io/posts/async-postgres-locks/","title":"Postgres Advisory Locks with Asyncio"},"https://burningdaylight.io/posts/connected-roomba-lora/":{"body":"With a basic setup working the next thing I wanted to do was make communication\nwireless.

The good news was\nOpenInterface was still useful, and there was plenty of room for the base\nclass after removing the debug and abstraction code, so I only compiled the\ncommands I knew I was going to use for version 1 and continued moving forward.\nclass OpenInterface:\n    def __init__(self, tx_pin, rx_pin, brc_pin, baud_rate=115200):\n        self._board = busio.UART(tx_pin, rx_pin, baudrate=baud_rate)\n        self._tx_pin = tx_pin\n        self._rx_pin = rx_pin\n        self._brc_pin = brc_pin\n        self._brc_pin.direction = digitalio.Direction.OUTPUT\n        self._baud_rate = baud_rate\n        self._stopped = True\n\n    def start(self):\n        if self._stopped:\n            self.wake_up()\n\n        for command in (b\"\\x80\", b\"\\x83\", b\"\\x87\"):\n            self._board.write(command)\n\n    def stop(self):\n        for command in (b\"\\x85\", b\"\\xAD\"):\n            self._board.write(command)\n        self._stopped = True\n\n    def wake_up(self):\n        for i in range(3):\n            self._brc_pin.value = False\n            time.sleep(0.5)\n            self._brc_pin.value = True\n            time.sleep(0.5)\n            self._brc_pin.value = False\n            time.sleep(0.5)\n\n        self._stopped = False\n\n\nAfter stripping things down and getting the Feather to start and stop the\nRoomba from the REPL I turned my attention to the Pi.\n\nWith the Pi Zero providing more resources installing the OS, setting up SSH and\ncompiling Python 3.7 took more time then getting the Circuit Python libraries\nworking. Blinka worked like a\ncharm and following the docs from above I had a quick\nscript\nto send start and stop packets via LoRa working in no time.\nwhile True:\n    try:\n        if not start_button.value:\n            msg = \"Starting Roomba.\"\n            logger.info(msg)\n            rfm9x.send(bytes(\"1\", \"ascii\"))\n            display.fill(0)\n            display.text(msg, 25, 15, 1)\n        elif not stop_button.value:\n            msg = \"Stopping Roomba.\"\n            logger.info(msg)\n            rfm9x.send(bytes(\"0\", \"ascii\"))\n            display.fill(0)\n            display.text(msg, 25, 15, 1)\n\nThe display on the bonnet was a nice touch so that I could watch the Feather in\na terminal while the Pi let me know immediately which button was pressed and\nwhich command I should expect the Feather to receive.\n\nNext Steps\nWith the boards talking to each other and the ability to start/stop the Roomba\nwith the press of a button the last thing to do was make this work when we are\nnot at home. While LoRa has a pretty good range I wanted this to work for my\nwife and I without having to worry about where we are. In part 3 I look at\nmaking this work with SMS.\n","id":"https://burningdaylight.io/posts/connected-roomba-lora/","title":"Connected Roomba Remote - LoRa"},"https://burningdaylight.io/posts/connected-roomba-managing-state/":{"body":"Last year I started work and completed the first prototype for managing a roomba\nvia sms and radio. Overall the prototype was a successful, but over time highly\nunreliable in the face of failure. Most of this came down to state management\nfor the API endpoint and the Roomba OI (Open Interface) code running on the\nFeather. This week I had the opportunity to sit down and fix some of that.\nThe latest version of the project can be found\nhere.\nRoomba\nIn previous version of the application that ran on the Feather listening for\nmessages over radio I had managed the application state in this class:\nclass OpenInterface:\n    def __init__(self, tx_pin, rx_pin, brc_pin, baud_rate=115200):\n        self._board = busio.UART(tx_pin, rx_pin, baudrate=baud_rate)\n        self._tx_pin = tx_pin\n        self._rx_pin = rx_pin\n        self._brc_pin = brc_pin\n        self._brc_pin.direction = digitalio.Direction.OUTPUT\n        self._baud_rate = baud_rate\n        self._stopped = True\n\nI had done this so that I couldn't send the Roomba signals that were invalid\nfor a given state based on the Open Interface documentation. The\ncircuitroomba project were I\noriginally implemented this actually did a lot more state management. Overall\nmaybe this would be helpful during application development, but I found it made\ncode on the board unreliable due to the size of the class object in memory and\nother work going on causing the board to eventually crash over an extended\nperiod of time.\nThe more I thought about this I also realized I had caused an even larger issue.\nThe Roomba itself manages state internally. It has all of the logic laid out in\nthe OI document impelmented internally keeping things \"safe\" and tracking if a\ngiven signal is valid or not. By adding my own state management layer on top of\nthis I opened the door for all kinds of trouble. First if the internal Roomba\nlogic differed from the OI documentation, or I implemented the OI logic\nincorrectly I would be sending the application developer down all kinds of\npaths trying to figure out why state transistion and command signals were not\nexhibiting the expected behavior. Why setup 2 FSMs when one will do, and only\none ends up being the true dispatch? If we did this at the sms API layer we\ncould have 3, all with the potential for bugs, unexpected behavior, logic\nmismatches, timing issues etc. It's a combinatorial explosion of state\nmanagement issues.\nSo stepping back, considering the separation of concerns I determined all the\nboard needed to do was listen for a given signal flag and pass that on to the\nRoomba. From there the Roomba can determine if the signal should be acted on\nbased on it's internal state.\nThe new implementation discards the class object and instead just uses a super\nloop and signal functions.\nwhile True:\n    try:\n        packet = rfm9x.receive(1)\n\n        if packet is not None:\n            packet_txt = str(packet, \"ascii\")\n            print(packet_txt)\n\n            if packet_txt == \"0\":\n                command_received(led)\n                led.value = True\n                stop(bot)\n                led.value = False\n            elif packet_txt == \"1\":\n                command_received(led)\n                wake_up(brc)\n                start(bot)\n                led.value = True\n            else:\n                print(\"\\nUnknown packet: {}\\n\".format(packet_txt))\n    except:\n        pass\n\nAdditionally from time to time signals can have issues that previously caused\nhanging in the application. Now the logic inside the super loop is wrapped in a\ntry/except to prevent corrupt date from completely crashing the application.\nInstead failures are ignored and we keep listening for the next signal. While\nthis isn't always a viable solution in the case of signaling the Roomba the\nstakes are low and this is something I'm comfortable with.\nPi Zero\nAfter fixing up the Feather board code I moved onto the Pi applications.\nPreviously I had setup a Flask application to act as the SMS webhook for Twilio.\nThis worked pretty well and was consistent over time, but there was the\noccasional hang running on the Zero that led me to look into managing the\nPython and Ngrok application with systemd. Converting from crontab was\nfairly easy. I created a few *.service files and placed them in\n/etc/systemd/system.\n[Unit]\nDescription=sms listener\nAfter=ngrok.service\n\n[Service]\nType=simple\nUser=pi\nWorkingDirectory=/home/pi\nExecStart=/home/pi/.virtualenvs/lora-pi/bin/python /home/pi/projects/roomba_supervisor/sms_listener.py\nRestart=on-failure\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\n\nOnce the files were created I ran the following commands:\nsystemctl enable sms_listener.service\nsystemctl start sms_listener.service\n\nAnd now all of the required applications (ngrok, sms listener, button listener)\nare managed by systemd. This controls their startup better than the previous\ncrontab setup and has the added benefit of restarting the service if it fails\nour.\nWrapping up\nBy observing and understanding the ways in which the prototyped system failed\nI was able to identify areas where behavior and functionality could be\nsimplified resulting in an overall more reliable system.

Fast forward to the winter of 2018 when I decided I would like\nto be able to start our Roomba away from home because of the noise it makes,\nand suddenly I had the project I was looking for. Digging around I found out\nabout the\nRoomba Open Interface\nand set out to start talking to my Roomba with\nCircuitPython.\nWill this work\nAfter reading through the Open Interface spec I decided it should be possible\nfor me to control the Roomba by using the Circuit Playground Express that I had\nwaiting on the shelf. Getting the kit out and using the clips available I\nconnected the Playground Express TX to the Roomba RX, opened a REPL and tried\nto wake the Roomba, but received no response.\nAfter some more searching I\nfound out\nthat certain series firmware will not respond to wake commands after 5 minutes\nwithout a signal. Knowing this, and pressing the power button once to wake the\nRoomba, I was able to START, STOP and DOCK the Roomba with controller code\nrunning on the Playground Express.\n\nNext steps\nAfter spending some more time confirming command structures, documentation and\nbehavior between CircuitPython and the Roomba Open Interface I decided to make\nthings easier by building a package\nto abstract the interactions.

It turns out in 2.2.0 a set of _outer functions\nwhere added that retain null for certain operations such as explode.\nUnfortunately some of these are not available in PySpark until 2.3 and I didn't\nhave the option to migrate from 2.2.x to 2.3.x.\nStackOverflow\nto the rescue. After reviewing the PySpark tag I didn't find any solutions with\naccepted answers so I went ahead and wrote my own question. Thanks to that I\nlearned a lot about PySpark/JVM interop and about some of the disparities\nbetween the JVM API and other language APIs.\nOtherwise()\nBased on some responses to my question I found another question that provided a\nscala solution involving .otherwise and casting the nested structure with a\nnull literal. None in Python. This seemed like the more direct solution\nwithout making use of private functionality in the library, so I opted to try\nimplementing the scala solution in PySpark first.\nflat_df = df.withColumn('dataCells', explode(col('dataCells')))\nflat_df = flatten_struct_cols(flat_df)\nflat_df.withColumn('dataCells_shape_test', explode(when(col('dataCells_shape').isNotNull(), col('dataCells_shape'))\n                                          .otherwise(array(lit(None).cast(flat_df.select(col('dataCells_shape')\n                                          .getItem(0))\n                                          .dtypes[0][1]))))).show()\n\n+--------------|--------------|--------------|---------------|---------------|--------------------+\n|dataCells_posx|dataCells_posy|dataCells_posz|dataCells_shape|dataCells_value|dataCells_shape_test|\n+--------------|--------------|--------------|---------------|---------------|--------------------+\n|             0|             1|           0.5|  [[1, square]]|            1.5|         [1, square]|\n|             2|             5|           0.5|   [[, circle]]|            7.5|          [, circle]|\n+--------------|--------------|--------------|---------------|---------------|--------------------+\n\nBut unfortunately it appears that the explode may have a precedence behind\nthe scenes that drops the row before otherwise is evaluated. With a quickly\napproaching deadline I unfortunately did not have time to dig deep into why\nthis was with other options on the table.\nInto the JVM\nWhile reviewing suggested solutions I found out that SparkContext has a\n_jvm object that provides access to org.apache.* functionality. Along with\nthis I also noticed that Databricks has an entire \"private\" api used with\nPython and Java. Part of this API is _to_java_column which makes it possible\nto transform a PySpark column to a Java column to match Java method signatures.\nLearning all of this, and knowing that the Java API already had explode_outer\nimplemented I reviewed the Java explode_outer\nmethod to verify the type signature and built my own function in Python to call\nthe Java function and return the column with null in place.\ndef explode_outer(col):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calling the explode_outer Java function from PySpark\n    \"\"\"\n    _explode_outer = sc._jvm.org.apache.spark.sql.functions.explode_outer\n    return Column(_explode_outer(_to_java_column(col)))\nflat_df_with_null = df.withColumn('dataCells', explode(col('dataCells')))\nflat_df_with_null = flatten_struct_cols(flat_df_with_null)\nflat_df_with_null = flat_df_with_null.withColumn(\"dataCells_shape\", explode_outer(col(\"dataCells_shape\")))\nflat_df_with_null.show()\n\n    +--------------|--------------|--------------|---------------|---------------+\n    |dataCells_posx|dataCells_posy|dataCells_posz|dataCells_shape|dataCells_value|\n    +--------------|--------------|--------------|---------------|---------------+\n    |             0|             1|           0.5|    [1, square]|            1.5|\n    |             1|             3|           0.5|           null|            4.5|\n    |             2|             5|           0.5|     [, circle]|            7.5|\n    +--------------|--------------|--------------|---------------|---------------+\nflat_df_with_null = flatten_struct_cols(flat_df_with_null)\nflat_df_with_null.show()\n\n    +--------------|--------------|--------------|---------------|--------------------|---------------------+\n    |dataCells_posx|dataCells_posy|dataCells_posz|dataCells_value|dataCells_shape__len|dataCells_shape__type|\n    +--------------|--------------|--------------|---------------|--------------------|---------------------+\n    |             0|             1|           0.5|            1.5|                   1|               square|\n    |             1|             3|           0.5|            4.5|                null|                 null|\n    |             2|             5|           0.5|            7.5|                null|               circle|\n    +--------------|--------------|--------------|---------------|--------------------|---------------------+\n\nAnd it works! With that I am able to flatten out arbitrarily nested collections\nin PySpark dataframes while retaining nulls when using Spark 2.2.x.\nWrapping Up\nA couple things to note; if you have an array with more than one struct as a\nmember this will fail, and if you have a deeply nested structure the growth of\nthis transformation is typically not sustainable on a large dataset.\nFinally I have questions that I hope to continue spending time on. For instance\nwhy are rows with null dropped at all? I wonder if the operation makes a new\ndataframe from the column to apply the operation to and then joins it back on\nan index and along the way that join loses nulls. Why are functions that are\nlossy not identified as such? Is there always a version lag between the JVM api\nand the PySpark api? I'm also curious how Catalyst handles denesting operations\nand adding new columns from the result of exploding arrays or flattening\nstructs.\nFinally instead of adding new columns I want to try using the MapType to\ninstead create a new column of key, value pairs that allows me to flatten out\narbitrarily deep collections into a MapType so that I can use the same\nmethodology on much deeper structures without adding a lot of columns that are\nmostly null.\nAdditional Links\n\nOriginal Question\nPySpark Data Flow\nCalling Java/Scala from PySpark\nSpark Architecture\nPySpark Internals\n\n","id":"https://burningdaylight.io/posts/dealing-with-null-transformations-in-pyspark/","title":"Dealing with NULL in PySpark transformations"},"https://burningdaylight.io/posts/docker-airflow/":{"body":"If you've spent time using Python for ETL processes or working with data\npipelines using tools from the Apache ecosystem then you've probably heard\nabout Apache Airflow. In this post I'm going\nto briefly write about why I'm using Airflow, show how you can get started with\nAirflow using docker and I will show how I customized this setup so that you\ncan do the same. Finally at the end I'll talk about a couple of issues I ran\ninto getting started with Airflow and docker.\nWhat is  Apache Airflow\nFrom the home page:\n\nAirflow is a platform to programmatically author, schedule and monitor\nworkflows.\n\nProgramatically being a key part so that you can create and orchestrate\nworflows/data pipelines using the same processes and tools that let you create\nreliable, scaling software.\nWhy  Airflow\nI don't plan to write much on this subject since it's been covered in depth\nelse where, but at work and often times when talking about Airflow the question\nof why Airflow versus X traditional solution where X is something like:\n\nSSIS\nInformatica\nStreamsets\nSnaplogic\n\ninevitably comes up. The primary reason I prefer a solution like Airflow to\nmore traditional solutions is because my ETL is code. While there are numerous\nbenefits to ETL as code my talking points are:\n\nYour data pipes/workflows go through the same processes that helps you create\nbetter products like TDD\nYour ETL development and production can be integrated with your CI/CD process\nBetter debugging tools\nFlexibility\n\nThat's not to say the traditional tools don't have their place, but my\nexperience is that any significantly complex data pipeline ends up making use\nof that tools script task (C# for SSIS, Java for Informatica) and now you have\nan amalgamation of GUI product and untested, undocumented and non versioned\ncode in production data pipelines.\nWhy conda\n\nConda is a cross-platform, Python-agnostic binary package manager. It is the\npackage manager used by Anaconda installations, but it may be used for other\nsystems as well. Conda makes environments first-class citizens, making it easy\nto create independent environments even for C libraries.\n\nBy day I'm a data engineer helping to build platforms, applications and\npipelines to enable data scientist. Because of this conda is a tool I've become\nfamiliar with and it let's me work across languages, but easily integrate those\nvarious languages into my Airflow dags.\ndocker-airflow\nTo get started with Airflow I highly recommend reading\nthe homepage and\ntutorial to get an idea of the core\nconcepts and pick up on the vocabulary used within the framework.\nAfter that there is a great project called\ndocker-airflow that you can get\nstarted with. This provides a quick way to get started with Airflow in an\nenvironment with sane defaults making use of Postgres and Redis.\nThis project provides an example dag and also allows you to load the Airflow\nexample dags via the LOAD_EX environment variable. Additionally you might\nwant to open up the Airflow dashboard and checkout the Connections tab where\nyou can setup things such as SSH an SSH connection to reference in your dags.\nCustomizing the setup\nThe docker-airflow project is a\ngreat start, but it makes assumptions that may not be true of your environment\nsuch as which database you plan to use, use of environment variables, etc.\nIf all you're needing to tweak is the behavior of the environment or Airflow\nyour first stop should be airflow.cfg in the /config directory. This is a\ncentralized location for Airflow settings and is checked after any settings\nfrom the environment are loaded. If you're trying to change settings related to\nwork pools, ssl, kerberos, etc this is probably the best place to get started.\nIf you're looking to change things related to your containers such as when to\nrestart, dependencies, etc then your going to want to checkout either the\nLocalExecutor or CeleryExecutor docker-compose files.\nFinally you might want to make bigger changes like I did such as using a\ndifferent database, base docker image etc. Doing this requires changing quite a\nfew items. The changes I made were:\n\nswitch to miniconda for my base image to use Intel Dist Python\nswitch to Microsoft SQL Server for the database\nswitch the task queue to RabbitMQ\n\nMost of this was driven by a desire to experiment and to learn more about tools\nthat I use day to day. Since I work in a data engineering shop there are\npackages from conda-forge that I like to use driving the miniconda switch,\nI've used MS SQL for the last 8 years professionally and I've been working on\nscaling with RabbitMQ over the last year.\nThe switch to miniconda was a one liner in the Dockfile:\nFROM continuumio/miniconda3\n\nThen to use IDP (Intel Distribution of Python) within the container I added\nthis towards the bottom:\nRUN conda config --add channels intel\\\n    &amp;&amp; conda config --add channels conda-forge \\\n    &amp;&amp; conda install  -y -q intelpython3_core=2019.1 python=3 \\\n&amp;&amp; conda clean --all \\\n\nAnd with that I can make use of conda packages alongside traditional Python\npackages within my Airflow environment.\nNext up I wanted to switch to MSSQL. Doing this was a matter of switching\nfrom Postgres in docker-compose and adding the MSSQL Linux drivers to the base\ndocker-airflow Dockerfile.\n#docker-compose\n\n    mssql:\n        image: microsoft/mssql-server-linux:latest\n        environment:\n            - ACCEPT_EULA=Y\n            - SA_PASSWORD=YourStrong!Passw0rd\n        ports:\n            - 1433:1433\n        volumes:\n            - /var/opt/mssql\n\nYou may or may not want to preserver your database volume so keep that in mind.\nSetting up the MSSQL Linux drivers is fairly straight forward following the\ndocumentation\nfrom Microsoft.\n#Dockerfile\n\n# MS SQL EULA\nENV ACCEPT_EULA=Y\n\nRUN curl https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc | apt-key add - \\\n    &amp;&amp; curl https://packages.microsoft.com/config/ubuntu/16.04/prod.list | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/msprod.list\n\nRUN apt-get update -yqq \\\n&amp;&amp; apt-get install -yqq mssql-tools unixodbc-dev\n\nOne thing to note if you're using a Debian based image is that Microsoft has a\nsomewhat obscure dependency on libssl1.0.0. Without that installed you will\nget some obscure unixodbc error connecting to MSSQL with sql-alchemy. To\nremedy this add the below to your Dockerfile.\n#Dockerfile\n\nRUN echo 'export PATH=\"$PATH:/opt/mssql-tools/bin\"' &gt;&gt; ~/.bash_profile\nRUN echo \"deb http://httpredir.debian.org/debian jessie main contrib non-free\\n\\\ndeb-src http://httpredir.debian.org/debian jessie main contrib non-free\\n\\\n\\n\\\ndeb http://security.debian.org/ jessie/updates main contrib non-free\\n\\\ndeb-src http://security.debian.org/ jessie/updates main contrib non-free\" &gt;&gt; /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jessie.list\n\nRUN apt update \\\n&amp;&amp; apt install libssl1.0.0\n\nFinally setup your connection string either in airflow.cfg or an Airflow\nenvironment variable\n. I like to use the Airflow environment variables and pass them in from a .env\nfile with docker-compose.\n#docker-compose\n\n        environment:\n            - LOAD_EX=n\n            - FERNET_KEY=46BKJoQYlPPOexq0OhDZnIlNepKFf87WFwLbfzqDDho=\n            - EXECUTOR=Celery\n            - AIRFLOW__CELERY__BROKER_URL=${CELERY_RABBIT_BROKER}\n            - AIRFLOW__CORE__SQL_ALCHEMY_CONN=${SQL_ALCHEMY_CONN}\n            - AIRFLOW__CELERY__RESULT_BACKEND=${CELERY_RESULTS_BACKEND}\n\nAnd finally the last big change I implemented was the switch to RabbitMQ\ninstead of Redis. Similar to the MSSQL switch this was just an update to the\ndocker-compose file.\n    rabbitmq:\n        image: rabbitmq:3-management\n        hostname: rabbitmq\n        environment:\n        - RABBITMQ_ERLANG_COOKIE=${RABBITMQ_ERLANG_COOKIE}\n        - RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_USER=${RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_USER}\n        - RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_PASS=${RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_PASS}\n        - RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_VHOST=${RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_VHOST}\n\nAnd setting up the right connection string for Celery to talk with rabbitmq.\nSimilar to the MSSQL connection string I put this in my .env file and\nreference it in my docker-compose file as seen above.\n# .env\n\nCELERY_RABBIT_BROKER=amqp://user:pass@host:port/\n\nOne thing to note is anytime you are referencing the host and running with\ndocker-compose you can reference the service id in this case rabbitmq as the\nhost name.\nAnd with that I have a nice Airflow environment that lets me make use of the\ndatabase I'm familiar with, a durable queue and packages across the Python and\nData Science ecosystems via conda.\nYou can find these changes in my fork of the\ndocker-airflow project. I've also\nopened a GitHub issue\nwith the goal of creating some way to track other community variations of\ndocker-airflow with the hope of helping others discover setups specific to\ntheir need.\nIssues so far\nI've been using the setup above for a couple weeks now with pretty good results.\nI've made use of some libraries like hdfs3 that have their latest releases in\nconda-forge and my familiarity with MSSQL has saved me some maintenance time.\nThe experience hasn't been without it's issues. The highlights are:\n\nAirflow packages\nmay not be what you want. See librabbitmq and celery. It's best to manage a\nrequirements.txt or conda.txt with your dependencies still.\nDependency management across multiple dags. In short with a standard setup\nyou need one package version and it needs to be installed everywhere. For an\ninteresting approach to this read\nWe’re All Using Airflow Wrong and How to Fix It\nSilent failures. Be aware of all the reasons why a worker may provide exit\ncode 0 especially with docker. This took a minute to catch when an NFS mount\nstopped showing new files being available, but the exit code 0 made things\nseem ok. This isn't Airflows fault, but just something to keep in mind when\nusing Airflow in an environment with docker and remote resources.\n\nReaching out\nHopefully this post helps you get started with\ndocker-airflow.

That said I've never been great at\ntaking courses that are not self paced partially because week to week my\nschedule can change dramatically between work and family. Because of this over\ntime I've tried out multiple platforms of learning such as Pluralsight, Khan\nAcademy, formal online masters programs etc. All of them have their pros and\ncons ranging of cost to quality to engaging content.\nLast year I started learning more about SoC type hardware via Circuit\nPlayground. This has lead me on an adventure to learn more and more about\nembedded systems, C and hardware. Most of this has been stitched together from\nvarious sources and ad hoc as the need arose in a personal project. Towards the\nend of summer I decided I wanted to formalize this learning and started to look\naround. There are online programs from universities like TESU, and individuals\noffering classes, but I stumbled across the UT 601 class on EdX and realized\nthe setup would be a good fit for me. Additionally EdX offers verified courses\nwith certificates which I thought might be nice in the future.\nSigning up and getting verified with EdX was easy. I was able to use my laptop\nand phone to complete all the task in under 30 minutes. The layout of EdX is\nvery similar to other online learning platforms that I've used.\nUT 601\nOnce I started UT 601 I started to run into a few more barriers. The course\nrequires the purchase of a Texas Instruments kit for use throughout, which\nmakes sense this is an embedded systems course. What I wasn't expecting was the\nuse of Keil. To complete the course I needed to be able to install Keil 4.2,\nand a simulator DLL (which was pretty neat) on a Windows platform. A couple\nannoyances there. This is an online course with the goal of global education\nopportunities, but immediately I'm locked into a platform, and additionally Arm\nplaces Keil behind a personal information collection form. I was happy that\nMicrosoft provides a Windows 10 ISO that I could use within a VM to work on the\ncourse. After downloading that though I found that VirtualBox didn't pass\nthrough the board USB connection so that I could make use of the Stellaris\nDebugging software/firmware that I would need. After some time fiddling with it\nI ended up switching to VMWare, and after switching the USB connection to pass\nthrough as 2.0 was able to get everything packaged up into a Windows VM with\nKeil, the Stellaris software, the simulator DLL and the appropriate Keil\nregistry edits. In case it would ever help anybody my VMWare config file is\nhere.\nAfter spending a couple days getting the IDE, hardware and VM all setup and\nplaying well together I dove into the course. Overall I enjoyed it. It exposed\nme to PIN programming and doing a lot of GPIO work that I haven't done in the\npast. Additionally it was a good refresh on concepts at the beginning like\npipelining. One thing I did notice is there was a big jump from lab 5 to 6. We\nwent from editing template projects to writing most of the project from the\nground. Each section provded a different amount of direction (not gradually\ndeclining, but instead seemingly random) on how to complete the lab. New\nconcepts were quickly introduced and some lacking explination such as using the\nKeil Oscilliscope and Analyzer. Overall it was a good course, but I would\nsuggest dedicating a couple weeks and doing it all at once due to how much it\nramps up half way through. The accompanying book is made available in each\nsection and I highly recommend reading it as the videos act more as highlights\nthan covering the material at a level that prepares you for the labs.\nThe one thing that was a minor annoyance throughout was the reliance on Keil\n(IDE's have a place but often hide what the compiler and tools are doing\ncreating a gap in knowing how stuff works) and the problems experienced by\ntaking this course in a VM. Other than that the course was interesting and\nchallenging.\nWrapping up\nOverall I'm glad I took and completed\nUT601. I learned a fair amount, and look forward to taking\npart 2\nafter the the new year. EdX is a platform I see myself continuing to use as it's\nbeen super simple, has a range of interesting content, and the course\nfacilitators are really responsive.\n","id":"https://burningdaylight.io/posts/edx-ut601-review/","title":"Review EdX UT601 Embedded Systems"},"https://burningdaylight.io/posts/entropy/":{"body":"noun: entropy; plural noun: entropies; symbol: S\n\na thermodynamic quantity representing the unavailability of a system's thermal\nenergy for conversion into mechanical work, often interpreted as the degree of\ndisorder or randomness in the system. \"the second law of thermodynamics says that\nentropy always increases with time\"\nlack of order or predictability; gradual decline into disorder.\n\"a marketplace where entropy reigns supreme\"\n(in information theory) a logarithmic measure of the rate of transfer of\ninformation in a particular message or language.\n\nEverything we build and learn requires constant maintenance and labor.\n","id":"https://burningdaylight.io/posts/entropy/","title":"Entropy"},"https://burningdaylight.io/posts/first/":{"body":"I've needed to start this for a while.

More to come soon.\n","id":"https://burningdaylight.io/posts/first/","title":"Getting Started"},"https://burningdaylight.io/posts/gen-con-pyportal/":{"body":"Recently I've heard about multiple people working on con badges and decided to\ntry my hand at a simple take on the idea. Since I had just recently received my\nPyPortal Adabox I thought I would use that as my first platform to get started.\nFrom the product page the PyPortal is:\n\nAn easy-to-use IoT device that allows you to create all the things for the\n“Internet of Things” in minutes. Make custom touch screen interface GUIs,\nall open-source, and Python-powered using tinyJSON / APIs to get news, stock,\nweather, cat photos, and more – all over Wi-Fi with the latest technologies.\nCreate little pocket universes of joy that connect to something good. Rotate\nit 90 degrees, it’s a web-connected conference badge #badgelife.\n\nLike many other CircuitPython powered devices the PyPortal has a great\nExplore and Learn page\navailable that walks you through getting the right firmware installed as well\nas providing hardware breakdowns, code demos and FAQ.\nOnce I had the PyPortal up to date and had gone through a couple demos I landed\non having my first badge being a simple menu systems. While many badges will\ncontain easter eggs or ways to interact with other badges I decided to keep it\nsimple for this first run. I wanted my badge to be able to display a couple\npieces of static data and have a couple interactive options.\nI landed on a Button menu that would show a couple maps, a photo of my\nbadge, a countdown to Gen Con, and a simple D20 roller.\n\nAlong the way I made extensive use of the\ndocs and\nsource code that\nAdafruit provides.\nI also found it easy to find documentation for the module I would pull in from\nthe library modules by referencing the list of submodules on\nRead the Docs\nCuriosities\nWhile building my badge I ran into some interesting edges that I hope to\nexplore further. I'm sharing these here just in case somebody else reads this\nand can avoid similar pitfalls or suggest a different direction.\n\nLarge buttons seem to lead to performance and OOM errors\n\nOriginally my menu had 8 buttons (one with information about Adafruit,\nanother with information about the project), but that wasn't stable.\nAfter 3 or 4 clicks gc or something else couldn't keep up with the\nmemory allocation and the badge would crash with a MemoryError\nMy schedule was also a menu of buttons originally. This let me setup a\nlist of tuples I could manipulate in code, but when I had 5 buttons\nspan the screen render time was visibly slow, and lead to inconsistent\nOOM errors.\n\n\nDifferent fonts have different performance characteristics\n\nLooking back this makes sense. Different glyphs will have different\nstructures. Depending on that a glyph can place different loads on the\nsystem. I tried a few of the \"performance\" font from GoogleFonts, but\nultimately landed on Arial Bold for a font that looked consistent,\nrendered quickly and didn't have a large file size.\n\n\nBetter ways to sleep?\n\nMy badge spends a lot of time in the main super loop polling if a\nbutton has been pressed. At this time I don't think CircuitPython\nsupports interrupts. I hope in the future i can figure out a better was to\nlet the device sleep, but capture an interrupt type event such as the\ndisplay being touched.\n\n\nPDB for CircuitPython\n\nI spent a lot of time running snippets in the REPL. This is a nice\nexperience to have for an embedded device, but I do miss having PDB or\nWebPDB to drop a breakpoint in my code, let it run and then inspect the\nstack, heap etc from a given point in my program. I believe MicroPython\ncontains this functionality so I'm guessing it's possible with\nCircuitPython I just haven't dug in to make it happen yet.\n\n\n\nLessons Learned\nSimilar to the interesting behaviors I found above I learned a bit about\ndeveloping with CircuitPython and how it can differ from my day to day Python\ndevelopment along the way.\n\nPython data structure sizes\n\nMany code bases make liberal use of dictionaries. In fact some say that\nPython is built on top of the dict data structure. It's incredibly useful\nto look items up by key, and provides some human readability over indexing\ninto a collection with no reference beyond position. That said Dictionaries\nare one of the largest\nbuiltin Python objects. One of the reasons for this is something called a\nload factor that I won't go into now, but suffice to say as you add more\nobjects to a dictionary and it approaches a given load factor it will\nautomatically grow in size. Because of this in a memory constrained\nenvironment I found myself removing dictionaries or list of dicts and using\nmore tuples and list of tuples.\n\n\nTake out the garbage\n\nPython Garbage Collection is handled via reference counting. Because of\nthis it's important to think about when an object (especially large objects\n) you are using come in scope, and when they leave scope. In an environment\nlike CircuitPython you may also want to call gc.collect() when you leave\nscopes with large objects to make sure they are garbage collected before\nyou carry on. This can help avoid some OOM errors.\n\n\nCareful wih that indirection.\n\nI found myself removing helper functions and other pieces of code that\nhelped keep things \"clean\". Often times I  did this because I was hitting\nperformance of OOM errors that would go away when I put the functionality\nin the parent scope. Because of this I have repeated code, and code that\nisn't what I would expect to pass code review day to day, but it works,\nachieved stability and gave the performance I'm looking for on my badge.\n\n\nTesting and profiling for this environment is still a challenge for me.\n\nI would love to be able to write a test for my function and then profile\nthat test to capture things like stack depth, object sizes, timing, etc.\nAnd since I have a test I could do this N times to see what kind of\nbehaviors emerge. Instead right now I manually make a change and validate.\nBecause of this I think I'm building an intuition of what is happening, but\nI can't verify it which leads me to assume my understanding has gaps, and\npotentially wrong assumptions today. Making this better can help me address\nthe point above.\n\n\n\nNext Steps\nSo with v1 of the badge prepared and ready for Gen Con 2019 I'm going to step\nback and work on some other items in this  space. While working on the project\nI found out that labels don't support an orientation flag. After mentioning\nthis in discord I opened an issue\non Github with some encouragement from @ladyada. Hopefully I can spend some\ncycles working on that.\nI also continue to think about how to write tests for CircuitPython. Since the\nruntime is tied to the boards it's not as simple as running the code in a\nCPython unittest environment. While there is a lot of overlap in the API and\nbehavior it's not a one to one match. I think being able to test the code would\nlead to faster development cycles and would open the door to better profiling\nand understanding of my applications behavior.\nFinally I plan to back up and read Making Embdedded Systems by Elicia White\nand visit some other embedded getting started materials. While I had a lot of\nideas for this project (and I'm happy with how it turned out) I realized that\nsince I'm not as familiar with this type of hardware environment I struggled at\ntimes to get the functionality I was looking for with the performance I needed.\nAcknowledgements\nThanks to the team at Adafruit. The devices they build and the creation of\nCircuitPython has lead me to pick up  a hobby that continues to be fun and\nencourages me to think in new ways about hardware and the programs I'm writing.\nAdditionally Adafruit has a\ndiscord\nwhere many people have been incredibly patient and helpful as I learn and ask\nquestions.\nContact\nI've really enjoyed working on this project. If you want to reach out feel free\nto follow up via email or on.\nYou can find out more about the badge and source code in the\nrepo\nMore Photos\nSome additional photos of the portal. I've ordered a case off\nthingiverse\n, but using the Adabox case while I wait.\n\n\n\n\n","id":"https://burningdaylight.io/posts/gen-con-pyportal/","title":"Creating a Con Badge with PyPortal"},"https://burningdaylight.io/posts/git-hooks/":{"body":"As part of setting up tools to run in\nour CI pipeline I also setup a git pre-pushhook\nto run the same tools automatically in the local context. Git provides\na variety of hooks as documented in the scm book, and they can be used to\nreliably automate different parts of your workflow.\nIn addition to the official docs this\npage has a nice summary\nCode\nThe pre-push hook I built for our project looks like:\n#!/bin/sh\n\nPROJECT_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)\necho \"\\033[32;1mRunning pre-push hook for${PROJECT_ROOT}\\033[0m\"\n\ndotnet restore $PROJECT_ROOT\n\necho \"\\033[34;1mRunning resharper formatter\\033[0m\"\ndotnet jb cleanupcode --verbosity=ERROR --config=$PROJECT_ROOT/.config/cleanup --settings=$PROJECT_ROOT/.editorconfig --no-buildin-settings $PROJECT_ROOT/AMS.sln\nformatted=$(git status --porcelain=v1 2&gt;/dev/null | wc -l)\nexit $formatted\n\necho \"\\033[34;1mRunning dotnet resharper inspector\\033[0m\"\ndotnet jb inspectcode --verbosity=ERROR AMS.sln -p=$PROJECT_ROOT/.editorconfig -o=$PROJECT_ROOT/reports/resharperInspect.xml\n\npwsh $PROJECT_ROOT/tools/CheckResharperInspection.ps1\nif [[ $? -eq 0 ]]\nthen\n    echo \"\\033[34;1mRunning resharper dupe finder\\033[0m\"\nelse\n    echo \"\\033[31;1mInspector Errors Found\\033[0m\"\n    exit $?\nfi\n\ndotnet jb dupfinder --verbosity=ERROR AMS.sln -o=$PROJECT_ROOT/reports/resharperDupFinder.xml\n\npwsh $PROJECT_ROOT/tools/CheckDupeFinder.ps1\nif [[ $? -eq 0 ]]\nthen\n    echo \"\\033[34;1mRunning dotnet test\\033[0m\"\nelse\n    echo \"\\033[31;1mDupe Errors Found\\033[0m\"\n    exit $?\nfi\n\ndotnet cake --target=docker-bg\ndotnet cake --target=dotnet-test\nif [[ $? -eq 0 ]]\nthen\n    dotnet cake --target=docker-down\n    echo \"\\033[34;1mGo go go!\\033[0m\"\nelse\n    dotnet cake --target=docker-down\n    echo \"\\033[31;1mTest failed\\033[0m\"\n    exit 1\nfi\n\nThe first thing that should stand out is that this is just a shell script.\nGit hooks are just that, making it easy to use shell, python, powershell\nor other tools with your hook.

One of the primary areas of concern was\naggregation statements. These were seen as functionality that would be\nparticularly troublesome to write in Python. As an example I was provided a\nSpark SQL query similar to this:\ntext = ocr_data.filter(col('lvl')==5).filter(f.length(f.trim(col'txt'))) &gt; 0).select(txt_cols) \\\n    .withColumn('c_txt' case_std(col('txt'))) \\\n    .drop('txt') \\\n    .withColumn('tk_pos', f.struct('wrd_nm', 'c_txt')) \\\n    .groupBy(ln_cols) \\\n    .agg(f.sort_array(f.collect_list('tk_pos')).alias('txt_array')) \\\n    .withColum('txt_ln', f.concat_ws(' ', col('txt_array.case_std'))) \\\n    .drop('txt_array')\n\nThis query was transforming token data generated by Tesseract into lines.\nBeyond the aggregation operation there was also some concern that the\noperation may be ran against quite large datasets depending on how much\nTesseract output was being manipulated\nat once.\nOutside of the raw functionality I was asked if the data could be structured\nto provide an interface with named columns in a style similar to SQL rather\nthan having to reference positional data.\nAll of this seemed fairly straightforward. Provided with some sample data I\npulled in the UDF that was already in Python and set out to apply the\ntransformations first illustrating how we could interact with the data in a way\nsimilar to SQL with pipeline transformations and named references.\nPorting Transformations\nimport itertools\n\nfrom csv import DictReader\nfrom collections import namedtuple\n\ndef case_std(x):\n    if x.isupper():\n        return x.title()\n    elif not x.islower() and not x.isupper():\n        return x.title()\n    else:\n        return x\n\nwith open(\"sampledata/export.csv\") as sample:\n    reader = DictReader(sample)\n    data = [row for row in reader]\n\na = filter(lambda x: int(x[\"level\"]) == 5, data)\nfiltered = filter(lambda x: len(x[\"text\"].strip()) &gt; 0, a)\nfixed = ({**row, 'text':case_std(row[\"text\"])} for row in filtered)\n\ntk_pos = named_tuple(\"tk_pos\", \"word_num, text\")\nresult = (dict(row, **{\"tk_pos\":tk_pos(row[\"wrd_num\"], row[\"text\"])}) for row in fixed)\n\nTo start I read the data in with a DictReader\nwhich allowed me to reference values by name like \"level\" and \"text\". I then\napplied similar data transformations making use of filter,\ncomprehensions,\nand unpacking to try and\nkeep a style similar to some PySpark operations.\nFinally I put the rest of the transformations into a generator expression\ncontaining a dict of namedtuple\nvalues so that later operations could continue working on named values in a\nmanner similar to SQL columns.\nGROUPBY\nWith the transformation and named values part out of the way I moved onto the\nGROUPBY aggregations. Thinking about GROUPBY the goal is to apply an\naggregation function to a unique value. That unique value can be represented\nmultiple ways, but I wanted to show the idea behind what was happening to help\nwith future port efforts. So on my first pass I wrote:\ngrouped = []\nseen = set()\n\n# Order is known because it represents data generated by tesseract\nfor row in fixed:\n    key = (row[\"page_num\"], row[\"block_num\"], row[\"par_num\"], row[\"line_num\"])\n\n    if key in seen:\n        continue\n\n    seen.add(key)\n\n    line = []\n\n    for r in fixed:\n        rkey = (r[\"page_num', r[\"block_num\"], r[\"par_num\"], r[\"line_num\"])\n        if key == rkey:\n            line.append(r[\"c_txt\"])\n\n    txt = \" \".join(line)\n    clean_txt = txt.strip()\n\n    if clean_txt:\n        grouped.append(\n            {\n               \"page_num\": row[\"page_num\"],\n               \"block_num\": row[\"block_num\"],\n               \"par_num\": row[\"par_num\"],\n               \"ln_num\": row[\"line_num\"],\n               \"text\": clean_txt,\n            }\n        )\n\nKeeping in mind that this was to conceptualize what could be happening behind\nthe scenes for the GROUPBY and AGG operation here we loop over our rows\ngenerating a hash from some values. Once we have this hash we check if we have\nseen it before by referencing a set. If this is a new value we find all\nvalues of the hash in our transformed data, append the tokens, handle empty\ntokens and finally add the data to our final dataset. At the end we have lines\nof text (instead of individual tokens) that can be referenced by page, block,\nparagraph and line number.\nWhile this works it's horribly inefficient. It stands out that we are\nreiterating our transformed data every time we find a new key. But the goal for\nthis wasn't to be efficient. It was to show the ideas expressed in SQL with\nPython. Specifically it was highlighting how to express a GROUPBY/AGG\noperation manually using hashes of values and tracking what we have and have\nnot seen providing a final dataset that was the same as the output of the SQL\nstatement.\nitertools\nContinuing on from that point one of my favorite Python modules is itertools.\nIf you haven't spent much time with it I highly recommend taking some of your\nexisting code and looking over it while scanning the itertools docs. I've used\nislice, chain and zip_longest innumberable times. Because of that I knew\nthere was a handy groupby function stowed in there too:\nMake an iterator that returns consecutive keys and groups from the iterable.\nThe key is a function computing a key value for each element. If not specified\nor is None, key defaults to an identity function and returns the element\nunchanged.\n\nGenerally, the iterable needs to already be sorted on the same key function.\n\nReplacing the block above:\nfinal = []\n\nfor key, group in itertools.groupby(\n    req, key=lambda x: (x[\"page_num\"], x[\"block_num\"], x[\"par_num\"], x[\"line_num\"])\n):\n    line = \"\".join([row['text'] + \" \" for row in group])\n    final.append({\"page_num\": key[0],\n                  \"block_num\": key[1],\n                  \"par_num\": key[2],\n                  \"line_num\": key[3],\n                  \"text\": line,\n                })\n\nAnd with that change we have a clean, faster implementation. Additionally since\nthis was a port of Spark SQL if the data was to get truly large it wouldn't be\nmuch work to start iterating through all of the pipeline in batches since we\ncan use generators all the way through.\nConclusion\nSo what was the point of sharing that here? Nothing specific. It was a fun\nexercise at the time, and it made me pause to consider how I would express\nGROUPBY on my own. The exercise also helped introduce some of my colleagues\nto the filter expression and in turn map and reduce. Using those they\nwere able to express a lot of their pipeline concepts without a lot of the\niteration structures they were used to having abstracted away. If you find\nyourself doing a lot of pipelining I recommend checking out itertools and\nfunctools. Both are built into the Python stdlib and provide a lot of helpful\nfunctionality.\n","id":"https://burningdaylight.io/posts/group-by-python/","title":"GroupBy Fun with SQL and Python"},"https://burningdaylight.io/posts/h3lou-q1-2020/":{"body":"Last year we kicked off the first Hardware Happy Hour in Louisville Kentucky,\nUSA.

That turned into showing how to make some\nnoise\nfollowed by a quick on/off switch demo. With a couple more code demos and\nshowing off the Arduino code library we decided to switch gears and look at\nCircuit Python before having some general open make time.\nWith Circuit Python we had the same demos with a different approach. Instead\nof using an IDE and editor we showed how you could put the board into\nbootloader mode and drag and drop the UF2 and code files directly on the board\nfor loading. Along with that we demo'd the ability to use REPL driven\ndevelopment on the boards for quick prototyping and feedback.\nArmed with Arduino and Circuit Python we decided it was time for us to step\nback and let people hack. Some had fun with accelerometer libraries while\nothers scanned colors and lit up LEDs. By the end of the night I was rick\nrolled by a Circuit Playground.\n\n\n\nMore photos from the event here\nLouisville Hardware Happy Hour 2020\nAs 2020 continues we have 3 more H3 events planned in Louisville. Similar to\nour 2019 event we are planning to have a Q2 and Q4 social. If you're in the\narea we would love to see or hear about your project over some food and drink\nat Great Flood. In Q3 we are hoping to\nacquire some scopes to run a scope tutorial making use of the Circuit\nPlayground boards and teaching attendees how they can see their programs in a\nnew way.\nSponsors\nWe (Austyn, Brad and I) want to give a huge shout out and thank you to the\nLouisville Civic Data Alliance. Without their\nsupport and sponsorship we would not be able to provide boards for all of the\nattendees to use. They have helped us kickstart a set of hardware that we can\nuse to drive future workshops and education experiences. Thank you for\nproviding us with the\nCode.org Circuit Playground Express Educators' Pack.\nThank you to LVL1 for hosting. LVL1 is an\namazing local resource in the area. If you haven't checked it out you should\ndefinitely try to make it to one of the\nOpen Meeting and Making events on Tuesday\nnights.\nThanks to Tindie for some awesome stickers and swag.\nAnd thank you to the various code.org donors\nwho made the Adafruit Educators Pack\npossible for us to purchase and use.\nSponsorship Assistance\nAs I previously mentioned we are looking to run a scopes workshop this fall. If\nyou or an organization you know is interested in sponsoring this event we are\nlooking for help in acquiring digital scopes to provide attendees with. If you\nare interested in helping please reach out.\nWhere to follow\nTo keep up with future H3 Louisville events we have a group setup on\ngettogether.community and\nwe are active in the #hardware channel for\nLouisville Slack.\nEvents will also be published to the\nLouisville Tech and\nH3 Louisville\ncalendars.\nYou can find our code and presentations on\nGithub.\n","id":"https://burningdaylight.io/posts/h3lou-q1-2020/","title":"Kicking off Hardware Happy Hour 2020"},"https://burningdaylight.io/posts/hackaday-connected-world/":{"body":"Recently Hackaday announced the results of the\nConnected World\ncontest.

At first,\nI wasn't quite sure what was wrong I only knew that the tool head couldn't\nraise on the right-hand side. In an email to Adrian (at Lulzbot) we figured\nout the part had a hairline crack. In a year without covid I could have gone\ndown to LVL1 to make a replacement part, but not\nthis year. Luckily Lulzbot was easy to get a print from, and really fast\ntoo (kudos to them, and that's nice to know for the future).\nWith this being my first repair I was a bit nervous. I had never taken my\nmini apart or tinkered too much instead opting for that with my prints.\nThe good news is Lulzbot has amazing documentation\nfor each printer that make repairs relatively straight forward. Beginning\nto end taking things apart and getting them back together per the doc\ntook me an hour, and then it was go time. My first print\nwas rocktopus which\ncame out great. Seeing the right-hand axis work as expected was a huge\nrelief, and gives me some confidence that I could do more for in the realm\nof mods and repairs in the future.\nWhy does this matter? Because if you can't fix it, you don't own it,\nand I was blown away how easy it was to fix my Lulzbot. On top of that\nit was fun.

I've seen this\napproach when working with C# for instance, but in Python I typically\nsee code bases mocking out these interface points rather than passing\nin interfaces to functions and classes.\nMocking context\nOne of my favorite constructs in Python is the\ncontext manager.\nThese are incredibly useful objects for defining what the creation and\ndestruction of different interfaces should do via__enter__ and __exit__.\n(Append a for async context managers)\nWhile useful they can be a bit tricky for mocking out in your test, and\nrecently when I started doing just that I couldn't find any good examples\nfor accomplishing this.

As I was working through the code I started to notice a pattern\nthat made me go back to the original feature ticket for a quick review of\nthe acceptance criteria. As I suspected there was a list of around 10\n\"if this then that\" scenarios detailed, all of which manifested as conditions\nin the code. Grabbing a pen and paper I started to draw out the criteria\nand as I suspected all the scenarios were captured by relationships and\noperations for a Tree.\nGoing back with this information I paired with the team on an update to\nthe PR where we reduced the amount of conditions tied directly to the business\ndomain, and refactored names so that future maintainers could interact\nwith the code understanding a tree, but maybe not understanding all the\nbusiness logic around the entities.\n\nin case it's helpful the C5\nproject has some collections not found in the .NET Standard library for\ninteracting with Trees. In general an interesting project I'm glad I\nlearned about.\n\nA similar opportunity emerged on the same project when we needed to make\nsure a value was unique over a series of operations. In this scenario while\nworking on a collection of objects we were able to use a HashSet\nto exit if Add\nreturned false instead of setting up a LINQ query. This\nresulted in less nesting, less code, and a simplified condition.\nThe Point\nThe reason I am writing this is that we should be using data structures\nto represent the business logic of our applications. This seems obvious,\nbut too often I have seen implementations brute force conditions leaving\ndata structures as an optimization, or a concern for \"technical\" projects.\nWhile we can use a series of if conditions and predicates to meet requirements\nin a crude way, using data structures provides an abstraction that can elevate\nterse business logic to a construct future maintainers can derive extra\nmeaning from.\n","id":"https://burningdaylight.io/posts/modeling-business-with-data-structures/","title":"Use data structures for your business logic"},"https://burningdaylight.io/posts/modules-and-packages/":{"body":"Most programming languages offer ways to organize your code into namespaces.\nThese namespaces are logical containers that group different names and\nbehaviors together and isolate them to that namespace.

Most of the time when talking about\ntiming and measurement in Python we see the use of timeit and various built\nin timing techniques. For this work I wanted a little more information about\nhow the application was interacting with the system, and what the performance\nlooked like from outside the application. Getting a rough view of this is\npretty easy on a nix using\n/usr/bin/time.\nParsing Time\nTo make use of time you simply call it with your application as an argument.\nYou can find the time args with man time, but on useful one is the -v flag\nfor more system information in the output, and an --output file path. Doing\nthis you get a fair amount of page, time and system information in your output\npackaged up in a file that you can parse. In my script I'm also including some\ninformation in the file name so I can know what source file my application was\nparsing relating to that time information.\n#!/bin/bash\n\nSRC_DIR_PATH=/data\nRESULTS=/profile\n\nfor file in $SRD_DIR_FILES; do\n   filename=$(basename -- \"$file\")\n   filebase=\"${filename%.*}\"\n   echo $filebase\n   /usr/bin/time -v --output=$PROFILE_RESULTS_DIR$filebase.txt cmd args\n   echo \"done\"\ndone\n\nls -1sh $SRC_DIR_PATH &amp;&gt; profiled_directory.size\n\nOnce the application has ran you can see the output of time in your file,\nbut you will also probably notice that it's just a text blob not ready for\naggregation. Overall parsing time is relatively straight forward with one\ngotcha. I use the below to translate the blob into rows and columns:\nimport os\nfrom typing import Tuple, List, Any, Union\n\n\ndef format_time_profile_output(fpath, fobject) -&gt; List[Any]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Takes a directory of files containing the output of /usr/bin/time\n    and transforms the time blob data to a series of rows and columns.\n    \"\"\"\n    f = os.path.join(fpath, fobject)\n    time_metrics = [fobject]\n\n    with open(f, \"r\") as tfile:\n        for line in tfile:\n            if \"Elapsed\" not in line:\n                clean_line = line.lstrip()\n                metric, sep, value = clean_line.rpartition(\":\")\n                time_metrics.append(value.strip())\n            else:\n                # Handling the special case of the Elapsed time\n                # format using : in the time formatting.\n                clean_line = line.lstrip()\n                metric, sep, seconds = clean_line.rpartition(\":\")\n                # we now have something like val = 43.45\n                # metric = Elapsed (Wall Clock) time (H:MM:SS or M:ss) 1\n                # partition again on metric, then combine back our time.\n                metric, sep, minutes = metric.rpartition(\":\")\n                # put time back into metrics\n                value = f\"{min}:{secs}\"\n                time_metrics.append(value.strip())\n                # setup tool second metric for easier evaluation of\n                # time metrics\n                minutes = float(int(minutes) * 60)\n                seconds = float(seconds)\n                seconds += minutes\n                time_metrics.append(seconds)\n    return time_metrics\n\nNotice the one edge case in Elapsed (wall clock) time...). All other\nrows end with \\n and seperate the metric name from the value with :.\nElapsed wall clock time however throws in a couple extra colons for fun.\nOverall not a big deal, but a little gotcha waiting in the details when\ngoing from a string to another object/format.\nUsing the script above you end up with a collection of rows and columns\nthat you can then use to find out how your application performed for that\nrun instance.\nA quick bonus script, since my application was reading in and writing\nout new files I wanted to include the size of the input files so I\ncould begin to understand the impact of the input file size on the\napplications time metrics.\nimport os\n\ndef format_size_output(fpath, fobject) -&gt; List[List[str]]:\n    f = os.path.join(fpath, fobject)\n    size_metrics = []\n\n    with open(f, \"r\") as sfile:\n        for line in sfile:\n            metric, sep, filename = line.rpartition(\" \")\n            size_metrics.append([metric.strip(), filename.strip()])\n    return size_metrics[1:]\n\nWith this and the above time parsing we have the input file size, name,\napplication command, page and time information.

I'll start by\nconfiguring Pelican and Github. Once that's working I'll then talk about\nconfiguring Gandi so you can use a custom domain. If you're using a different\ndomain provider you may need to use different settings, but Github has plenty\nof documentation around this that I'll provide links for. Using Pelican on\nWindows isn't that much different than macOS or Linux, but you won't find as\nmany tutorials or be able to use the quickstart makefile.\nGithub Pages Setup\nThe first thing you should do is login to Github and then setup a Github pages\nrepo. You can read more detailed istructions here:\nhttps://pages.github.com/ or create a repo that\nfollows the pattern:\n    &lt;reponame&gt;.github.io\n\nI followed a pattern for User Github pages. This will be important when\npublishing with Pelican.\nhttps://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/\nPelican Local\nWith that out of the way we want to move on to setting up our project on\nWindows. I'm using Anaconda and I will be creating a new conda environment for\nthis project.\n    cd C:\\Users\\&lt;username&gt;\\source\\repos\n    mkdir pelican_blog\n    conda create -n blogging python=3.6\n    conda activate blogging\n    pip install pelican ghp-import markdown\n    cd pelican_blog\n    pelican-quickstart\n\nThe main thing to pay attention to when you go through the quickstart prompts\nis that you won't need or be able to use the makefile with Windows. Once you\nhave completed the quikstart there are a couple things to pay attention to.\n\nYour articles should be markdown documents in the content folder.\npelicanconf.py contains various settings related to you blog.\npublishconf.py can be left alone because we are using ghp-import\n\nPublishing\nGo ahead and create a file under content. Something like getting_started.md\nand add some text. Once you've done that switch back to the terminal prompt.\n    pelican content -o output -s pelicanconf.py\n    git add .\n    git commit -m \"initial commit\"\n    ghp-import output\n    git push git@github.com:alexhagerman/alexhagerman.github.io.git gh-pages:main\nCustom Domain URL\nOk, now that we have Github setup and we can see our blog pages I want to\nlook at the steps required to use my custom domain hosted by Gandi with the\nGithub pages. With Gandi we want to modify our A Records to allow routing to\nGithub. Logging into your Gandi dashboard, select domains from the menu and\nthen DNS records. On this page you should be able to edit your DNS record and\nadd the following:\nhttps://wiki.gandi.net/en/dns/zone/a-record\n    @ 10800 IN A 185.199.108.153\n    @ 10800 IN A 185.199.109.153\n    @ 10800 IN A 185.199.110.153\n    @ 10800 IN A 185.199.111.153\n\nOk finally navigate back to your Github repo and go to the settings page. Under\nsettings scroll down until you see Github pages. You should see a textbox\nallowing you to enter a custom domain. Add that, and if possible I recommend\nchecking the enforce https box below this.\nWrapping Up\nWith that done you should be good to go. Whenever you want to write a new\narticle create a markdown document in the content folder and follow the same\nsteps above for publishing. One last note if this doesn't work immediately you\nmight want to wait before beginning to change settings since your A record\nchanges can take some time to replicate.\n","id":"https://burningdaylight.io/posts/pelican-on-windows/","title":"Publishing with Pelican on Windows"},"https://burningdaylight.io/posts/pyspark-intro/":{"body":"This month at DerbyPy I provided a high\nlevel introduction to PySpark. For this talk I went over the Spark execution\nmodel at a high level, talked about the difference between the PySpark\nDataframe and RDD api, and provided some examples of how to use both. As part\nof this I put together a jupyter notebook and some scripts that can be used via\nspark-submit along with instructions on how to run PySpark locally.\nIf you're interested in the material and presentation they can be found\nhere.\n","id":"https://burningdaylight.io/posts/pyspark-intro/","title":"DerbyPy Intro to PySpark"},"https://burningdaylight.io/posts/recurse/":{"body":"Recently I received from JSON like data that I needed to transform into a\ntabular dataset. As part of that there was a specific key that could occur as a\nchild of different keys at different depths in the structure. Not only could\nthe key I needed appear at different locations and depths, but when it was\nlocated it was possible that it would have N sibling occurrences I needed to\nretrieve at the same location. Finally for all of these there were a set of id\nand date keys at the top level of the structure that I was asked to include\nwith each search key result.\nI took a couple different paths on my way to solving this. One of the first\nthings I found was the total depth was inconsistent across the structures. Not\nonly that, but it wasn't uncommon to find the key scattered across depths up\nto 5 or 6 levels deep. The function below is what I ended up using. It's a\nrecursive search that relies on the fact that the data is JSON like. Instead\nof trying to pull the parent keys out as part of the search I have a function\nthat parses out the id and date keys passing those into this function as base.\nThen a search is performed on the input object checking the dictionary\ncollections for all instances of the search key and when located appending the\nsearch keys value to the base data, which is then added to a list of results\nwhich is returned when the entire collection has been searched.\nGotchas\n\nThis needed to be Python 2 and 3 compatible so pay attention to iterating\ndictionary keys and values when you have this requirement. There are\ndifferent ways to handle this. I used future.\nThe way that Python appends to list can be tricky. This bit me when I found\nthat results contained the right number of results, but all of my results\nwhere the same and where based on the last hit. This is because I was calling\nappend on base which was creating bindings that I mutated on each search\nresult. Luckily Python has a copy module in the standard library to help\nwith this scenario.\n\nProblem Solved\nThe function below represents my final result. This worked well on the sample\ndata, and eventually was used on PySpark RDDs to process hundreds of millions\nof structures quickly.\nimport copy\nfrom future.utils import iteritems\n\ndef search(input, row_base, search_key, results):\n\n\"\"\"\nA search function to help transform nested JSON like objects into tabular rows.\n\nThe function takes a JSON like object as input along with a search key and\nreturns a row for each occurrence of the key in the object.\n\nrow_base is expected to be a list containing any base data you would like associated\nwith the search_key data.\n\"\"\"\n\n    if input:\n        for i in input:\n            # If input contains a list run it through search again since it\n            # may contain dictionaries with the key being searched\n            if isinstance(i, list):\n                search(i, row_base, search_key, results)\n            # If input contains a dictionary check if it contains the search_key\n            # Also check if any of the values are list or dictionaries that need\n            # to be searched\n            if isinstance(i, dict):\n                for k, v in iteritems(i):\n                    # If the search_key is located deepcopy row_base to prevent changing\n                    # row_base on future hits. Create full row and append to results\n                    if k == search_key:\n                        row = copy.deepcopy(row_base)\n                        row.append(i)\n                        results.append(row)\n                        continue\n                    elif isinstance(v, list):\n                        search(v, row_base, search_key, results)\n                    elif isinstance(v, dict):\n                        search(v, row_base, search_key, results)\n\n    # Search has been exhausted return search results to caller.\n    # Results will be a list of list.\n    return results\nNext Steps\nSince this works there are a couple of ideas I want to explore with it.\n\nThis seems like a good place to gain experience with Python type annotations.\nSince this needs to work in a pure Python environment as well as a PySpark\nenvironment I want to do some profiling, but I'm not sure how tools like\nCython or Numba will work/interact with the PySpark piece of this. That will\nbe interesting to explore.\nIt would be interesting to add depth tracking and see if there are any\nlevels where the search key never occurs so that the function could\npotentially skip iteritems at that level.\n\nDocs\nFor more information documentation on copy and future you can\ncheck out the documentation.\n\nhttps://docs.python.org/3.6/library/copy.html\nhttp://python-future.org/\n\nContact\nI'm sure others will have different ideas and approaches to something like\nthis.

I\nthink I got a taste for it as a member of the PyMSSQL project and it has\ncontinued on from there. Recently I worked on the initial CI setup for a C#\nproject. As part of the setup I took the time to look at what lint and\nanalysis tools we wanted to integrate into our project.\nFor C# some of the more common tools appear to be:\n\nRoslyn Analyzers\nSonarsource\nNDepend\nJetbrains Resharper\n\nI won't go into the full criteria for our choice of Resharper (I'll update this post\nif I end up writing that up one day), instead I'll summarize that Resharper provided:\n\neasy cross platform setup\nide/editor and shell agnostic\nworks the same locally and in CI.\nopinionated by default\n\nResharper Command Line Tools\nFrom the docs\nReSharper Command Line Tools is a set of free cross-platform standalone tools\nthat help you integrate automatic code quality procedures into your CI, version\ncontrol, or any other server.\n\nYou can also run coverage analysis from the command line.\n\nThe Command Line Tools package includes the following tools:\n\n- InspectCode, which executes hundreds of ReSharper code inspections\n- dupFinder, which detects duplicated code in the whole solution or narrower\nscope\n- CleanupCode, which instantly eliminates code style violations and ensures a\nuniform code base\nInstall\nTo get started with Resharper tools (assuming you already have .NET Core\ninstalled) run\ncd &lt;project&gt;\ndotnet new tool-manifest\ndotnet tool install JetBrains.ReSharper.GlobalTools --version 2020.2.4\n\nWhich installs the Resharper Global Tools\nat the project level. This then allows CI and other contributors to use\ndotnet tool restore in the future.\nConfiguration\nOut of the box inspect, format, and dupefinder all have default configurations\nthat work well. That said each team has their own needs and preferences you\nmay want these tools to promote. While there are a few ways to configure\nthese tools I found using editorconfig\nto be the most human readable approach.\nFor additional details on the editorconfig format see the docs\nand this property index.\nRunning\nRunning the tools from a shell is relatively easy:\njb cleanupcode --verbosity=ERROR --config=./.config/cleanup --settings=./.editorconfig --no-buildin-settings ./Project.sln\njb inspectcode --verbosity=ERROR Project.sln -o=./reports/resharperInspect.xml\njb dupfinder --verbosity=ERROR Project..sln -o=./reports/resharperDupFinder.xml\n\nOne thing to note is that by default the autoformatting will attempt to enforce\nline endings. If you have a team working across multiple platforms and using git\nto automatically handle line endings these can come into conflict. It's up to\nyou and your team to decide if you want to handle this by tweaking git behavior,\neditorconfig or another method.\nCI\nIf your using Team City see this\ndoc for details.\nWith everything running in our shell locally we can also set things up to run\nin our CI pipeline. Running the tools is easy as long as your CI platform has\na shell like task/step/operator:\n- script: |\n    dotnet tool restore\n    jb cleanupcode --verbosity=ERROR --config=./.config/cleanup --settings=./.editorconfig --no-buildin-settings ./Project.sln\n    jb inspectcode --verbosity=ERROR Project.sln -o=./reports/resharperInspect.xml\n    jb dupfinder --verbosity=ERROR Project..sln -o=./reports/resharperDupFinder.xml\ndisplayName: 'Resharper'\n\nOf course you will probably break these up for easier maintenance and\nreporting.\nRunning the tools is easy. The trick is detecting when these tools find\nan issue. I'll share what I did in case it's helpful, but long term it\nwould be great if Jetbrains had the tools exit with documented status\ncodes for different issues. As it stands the tools only exit with an\nerror if the tool fails, not when issues are reported.\nCleanupCode\nSince CleanupCode will format our file rewriting it on disk we can use\ngit to detect the change.\nformatted=$(git status --porcelain=v1 2&gt;/dev/null | wc -l)\nexit $formatted\ndupFinder\ndupFinder outputs an XML file highlighting any issues found. Powershell's\nbuilt in XML support makes it easy enough to query this file and see if any\nissues exist.\n$Result = Select-Xml -Path $(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/reports/resharperDupFinder.xml -XPath \"/DuplicatesReport/Duplicates/*\"\nIf ($Result -eq $null) { [Environment]::Exit(0) } Else { [Environment]::Exit(1) }\nInspectCode\nSimilar to dupFinder InspectCode documents issues with an XML file, and\nonce again we can use Powershell to detect if there are any issues to fix.\n$Result = Select-Xml -Path $(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/reports/resharperInspect.xml -XPath \"/Report/Issues/Project/*\"\nIf ($Result -eq $null) { [Environment]::Exit(0) } Else { [Environment]::Exit(1) }\n\nAnd since dupFinder and InspectCode output XML it can be useful to save\nthese as CI artifacts for review. In Azure Pipelines this looks like:\n- task: PublishPipelineArtifact@1\n  inputs:\n    targetPath: '$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/reports/'\n    artifactName: 'measurements'\n  condition: always()\n  displayName: 'Save ReSharper Results For Review.'\nWrapping Up\nWe've been using the ReSharper tools for a few months now and I have to say they\nprovided what I was looking for in the beginning. The tools have been easy\nto use, help us maintain our code and haven't boxed us in or required a lot\nof extra time on configuration and unseen gotchas. The only criticism I have is\ncold start time is pretty slow for cleanupcode, and the return exit codes\ncould be better. Both of these would also help with CI, and our git hook setup.\nOtherwise I think these will continue to serve us well and let us focus\non our project delivery.\n","id":"https://burningdaylight.io/posts/resharper-global-tools/","title":"Getting started with Resharper Global Tools"},"https://burningdaylight.io/posts/selfhosted/":{"body":"Over the last few years I built up a sprawling list of dependencies\nfor my home project and blog workflow. Earlier this year I decided\nit was time to cut down on that list and host my service dependecies\nlocally where I could. While it took me a while I reached a point\nwhere I no longer tweak the setup week to week and decided it was\ntime to write up the process.\nA quick list of the tools I used for orchestration:\n\nshell\nDNS\nTraefik2\ndocker/docker-compose\nalpine linux\n\n(D)DNS\nThe first thing I needed to do was make my services easy to reach local\nand remote. Since this is all running behind my home router that also\nmeans that my IP can change from time to time. To handle this I made\nuse of Gandi's DNS API, and setup a shell script\nto run with cron on my router to keep my DNS records up to date. With\nDNS ready I moved on to Traefik.\nTraefik\nTraefik is a really nice routing/proxy service\nthat can inspect container labels and setup route forwarding while\nhandling certificate management, traffic metrics and more. The main\ncallout (other than what you will find in the docs\n) is to keep an eye on what version you are using versus what others\nused in examples, and that non http based traffic (for instance ssh)\nrequires a little more setup. Beyond that Traefik has been really\nnice to use and made adding/removing various services easy when coupled\nwith docker.\ndocker-compose\nWhile k8s is the current hot orchestration tool I wanted to keep things\nsimple. I don't have a need to cluster any of my home tools, and while\ndistributed systems are interesting they also require a lot of work. I\nleft those at my day job and use compose + duplicity\nfor my home setup.

SICP is a book that was\nfirst published in 1985 and has grown to have a bit of a reputation in various\ncircles of software engineering. The book itself explores many areas of\ncomputer science with a language called Scheme (a lisp). For the course we\nmade use of  Racket and Python to explore those same concepts working\nthrough the book with an eye to it's impact on modern language and design.\nA quick note. This course was unlike any other I have been in so far. David is\nreally good at giving learners the time and space to think as he lays out\nreally dense material and like a tour guide provides interesting insights\nabout the landscape. Another great part of the class was the size and how Dave\ngives people time to engage each other. Each morning we shared ideas,\nexperiences and other stories over breakfast before throwing ourselves into\nthe material breaking for lunch to contemplate what we had just built or\ndiscovered rounded off with an afternoon coffee. Overall this was a fantastic\neducational experience and I hope I get the opportunity to repeat it with\nsome of Dave's other courses in the future.\nThroughout the week we engaged with various problems in the book such as\nevaluation models, abstraction, symbolic data and more. Each time we\napproached a problem we were encouraged to think as language designers and\nimplementors rather than language users. In doing so we put ourselves in a\ndifferent state approaching problem solving by extending the features of our\nlanguage. This led us to implementing object hierarchy and evaluation models,\ndispatching state handling and creating custom interpreters with domain\nspecific features to solve problems.\nOne part of SICP book that stood out was the use of 'wishful thinking' as our\nprogramming model. We would look at a problem (for instance a constraints issue\nfor assigning tenants to floors) and ask ourselves what a procedure or feature\nwould look like for accepting the data and solving said problem. We would then\nimplement this procedure and even mock calling other procedures that did not\nexist yet to model what we felt like an optimal interface might look like. From\nthere we would build down implementing each new layer with wishful thinking.\nThis came in contrast to a lot of my day to day experience approaching problems\nbottom up implementing low level details and data processing logic on our way\nto an isolated solution. In some ways it felt similar to TDD if you mock out\nall the functionality you don't have yet, but again with the top down mindset\nof I want the langauge to do X for me.\nMany other topics are covered throughout SICP. The book itself is very top down\nstarting with the language and going all the way down to implementing a\nVM/register machine by the end of the book. Over time I may write some more\nabout those topics. All in all the course was incredibly interesting. The\nconversations around lunch about the nature and philosophy of computing were a\nlot of fun and spawned by the material being covered as well as the various\nbackgrounds we all had in our day to day work. You don't leave the course with a\nnew package or framework in your toolbelt. Instead you've examined of of the\nunderlying fundamentals of languages, computing and software. This equips you\nwith new models for thinking that will hopefully impact any future computing\nthat you take part in. While the material is dense I think anybody that truly\nenjoys engaging with our craft would benefit from engaging with the SICP\nmaterial in this setting.\nIf anybody has questions about the course I'd be more than happy to talk about\nthe material. For those of you who don't know\nDavid Beazley I would\nencourage you to visit his site or search his name on YouTube as he has a lot\nof interesting material that encourages the learner to engage the material.\n","id":"https://burningdaylight.io/posts/sicp-beazley-review/","title":"The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs in 2020"},"https://burningdaylight.io/posts/system-status-observer/":{"body":"I have a bad habit of creating side projects for my side projects.\nA couple months ago I switched from running my blog with Pelican and Gitlab\nPages to Zola and Cloudflare Workers. I didn't do a write up on it, but if\nyou're interested there's a good\npost by Steve Klabnik\nto get you started. It was a surprisingly easy switch, and gaps between\nwriting haven't been as difficult with the better tools. After getting that\nsetup I read about\nCloudflare Workers KV\n, thought it sounded really neat and started to think about what I might build.\nOn another project I need to signal\nbetween different systems a simple status. Naturally that lead to me building a\nstatus page. I setup a Cloudflare Worker that receives POST from N systems,\nstores the date of the last POST uses that to provide a status when asked.\nconst setCache = (key, data) =&gt; LOCAL_STATUS.put(key, data);\nconst getCache = key =&gt; LOCAL_STATUS.get(key);\n\nfunction sleep(ms) {\n    return new Promise(resolve =&gt; setTimeout(resolve, ms));\n}\n\nfunction dateToStatus(dateTime) {\n    var isoDateNow = Date.now();\n    var dateDiff = (isoDateNow - dateTime);\n    if (dateDiff &lt; 180000) {\n    return 1\n    } else {\n    return 0\n    }\n}\n\nasync function getStatuses() {\n    const cacheKeys = await LOCAL_STATUS.list();\n    while (!(cacheKeys.list_complete === true)) {\n    sleep(5)\n    }\n\n    const numKeys = cacheKeys.keys.length;\n    var statuses = [];\n\n    for (var i = 0; i &lt; numKeys; i++) {\n    var c = cacheKeys.keys[i];\n    var epcDate = await getCache(c.name);\n    var data = {date: Number(epcDate), name: c.name};\n    data.strDate = new Date(data.date).toISOString();\n    data.status = dateToStatus(data.date);\n    data.statusIndicator = getStatusIndicator(data.status);\n    statuses.push(data);\n    }\n\n    const body = html(JSON.stringify(statuses || []));\n\n    return new Response(body, {\n    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'text/html' },\n    });\n}\n\nasync function getStatus(cacheKey) {\n    var cacheDate = await getCache(cacheKey);\n\n    if (!cacheDate) {\n    return new Response('invalid status key', { status: 500 });\n    } else {\n    var status = dateToStatus(cacheDate);\n    return new Response(status, {status: 200});\n    }\n}\n\nasync function updateStatus(cacheKey) {\n    try {\n    var isoDate = Date.now();\n    await setCache(cacheKey, isoDate);\n    var strDate = new Date(isoDate).toISOString();\n    return new Response((cacheKey + \" set at \" + strDate + \"\\n\"), { status: 200 });\n    } catch (err) {\n    return new Response(err, { status: 500 });\n    }\n}\n\nasync function handleRequest(request) {\n    let statusKey = new URL(request.url).searchParams.get('service');\n    let queryType = new URL(request.url).searchParams.get('query');\n\n    if (request.method === 'POST') {\n    return updateStatus(statusKey);\n    } else if (queryType === 'simple') {\n    return getStatus(statusKey);\n    } else {\n    return getStatuses();\n    }\n}\n\naddEventListener('fetch', event =&gt; {\n    event.respondWith(handleRequest(event.request))\n})\n\nWith that anything that can POST can \"check in\" with the endpoint.

They even have a web playground\nthat you can start with.\nTwo things I do wish were easier are interacting with K/V from Rust. This is\nprobably partially related to how new I am to Rust, but working with K/V from\nJS is super easy, while this\nthread\ndocuments another experience with Workers and Rust in more detail. Another mild\nannoyance is working with different workers from the same machine and how API\nkeys are handled. There are some suggestions for this, but non of them feel\nergonomic at this time.

Although training\nwent well:\nINFO:tensorflow:Saving to \"/Users/n0mn0m/projects/on-air/voice-assistant/train/model/speech_commands_train/tiny_conv.ckpt-18000\"\nI0330 10:34:28.514455 4629171648 train.py:297] Saving to \"/Users/n0mn0m/projects/on-air/voice-assistant/train/model/speech_commands_train/tiny_conv.ckpt-18000\"\nINFO:tensorflow:set_size=1445\nI0330 10:34:28.570324 4629171648 train.py:301] set_size=1445\nWARNING:tensorflow:Confusion Matrix:\n [[231   3   3   0   4]\n [  2 178   6  29  26]\n [  3  12 146   2   2]\n [  4  17   2 352  21]\n [  2  16   7  16 361]]\nW0330 10:34:32.116044 4629171648 train.py:320] Confusion Matrix:\n [[231   3   3   0   4]\n [  2 178   6  29  26]\n [  3  12 146   2   2]\n [  4  17   2 352  21]\n [  2  16   7  16 361]]\nWARNING:tensorflow:Final test accuracy = 87.8% (N=1445)\nW0330 10:34:32.116887 4629171648 train.py:322] Final test accuracy = 87.8% (N=1445)\n\nThe model didn't respond well once it was loaded onto the ESP-EYE. I tried a\ncouple more rounds with other keywords and spectrogram samples with similar\nresults.\nBecause of the brute force nature that I used to generate audio the synthetic\ntraining data isn't very representative of real human voices. While the\nexperiment didn't work out, I do think that generating data this way could be\nuseful with the right amount of time and research. Instead of scaling parameters\nin a loop I think researching the characteristic of various human voices and\nusing those to tune the data generated via espeak could actually work out well.\nThat said it's possible the model may pick up on characteristics of the espeak\nprogram too. Regardless, voice data that is ready for training is still a hard\nproblem in need of more open solutions.\nAlong with the way I scaled the espeak parameters another monkey wrench is that\nthe microspeech model makes use of a CNN and spectrogram of the input audio\ninstead of full signal processing. This means it's highly likely the model will\nwork with voices around the comparison spectrogram well, but not generalize.\nThis makes picking the right spectrogram relative to the user another key task.\nBecause of these results and bigger issues I ended up tweaking my approach and\nused\nvisual\nas my wake word followed by on/off. All of these are available in the TF command\nwords dataset, and visual seems like an ok wake word when controlling a display.\nFor somebody working on a generic voice assistant you will want to work on audio\nsegmentation since many datasets are sentences, or consider using something like\nSkainet. All of this was less fun\nthan running my own model from synthtetic data, but I needed to continue\nforward. After a final round of training with all three words I followed the TF\ndocs to represent the\nmodel as a C array and then flashed it onto the board with the rest of the\nprogram. Using idf monitor I was able to observe the model working as\nexpected:\nI (31) boot: ESP-IDF v4.1\nI (31) boot: compile time 13:35:43\nI (704) wifi: config NVS flash: enabled\nI (734) WIFI STATION: Setting WiFi configuration SSID Hallow...\nI (824) WIFI STATION: wifi_init_sta finished.\nI (1014) TF_LITE_AUDIO_PROVIDER: Audio Recording started\nWaking up\nRecognized on\nI (20434) HTTPS_HANDLING: HTTPS Status = 200, content_length = 1\nI (20434) HTTPS_HANDLING: HTTP_EVENT_DISCONNECTED\nI (20444) HTTPS_HANDLING: HTTP_EVENT_DISCONNECTED\nGoing back to sleep.\nWaking up\nRecognized off\nI (45624) HTTPS_HANDLING: HTTPS Status = 200, content_length = 1\nI (45624) HTTPS_HANDLING: HTTP_EVENT_DISCONNECTED\nI (45634) HTTPS_HANDLING: HTTP_EVENT_DISCONNECTED\n\nThis was an educational experiment. It helped me put some new tools in my belt\nwhile thinking further about the problem of voice and audio processing. I\ndeveloped some\nscripts to\nrun through the full data generation, train and export cycle. Training will need\nto be done based on the architecture somebody is using, but hopefully it's\nuseful.\nThe code, docs, images etc for the project can be found\nhere and I'll be posting updates as I\ncontinue along to HackadayIO and\nthis blog.

Right now I've settled on the wake\nwords Hi Smalltalk. After the wake word is detected the model will then\ndetect silence, on, off, or unknown.\nMy starting point for training the model was the\nmicro_speech\nand\nspeech_commands\ntutorials that are part of the Tensorflow project. One of the first things I\nnoticed while planning out this step was the lack of good wake words in the\nspeech command dataset. There are\nmany voice datasets available\nonline, but many are unlabeled or conversational. Since digging didn't turn up\nmuch in the way of open labeled word datasets I decided to use on and off\nfrom the speech commands\ndataset\nsince that gave me a baseline for comparison with my custom words. After\nrecording myself saying hi and smalltalk less then ten times I knew I did\nnot want to generate my own samples at the scale of the other labeled keywords.\nInstead of giving up on my wake word combination I started digging around for\noptions and found an interesting\nproject where\nsomebody had started down the path of generating labeled words with text to\nspeech. After reading through the repo I ended up using\nespeak and sox\nto generate my labeled dataset.\nThe first step was to generate the\nphonemes for the wake words:\n$ espeak -v en -X smalltalk\n sm'O:ltO:k\n\nI then stored the phoneme in a word file that will be used by generate.sh.\n$ cat words\nhi 001 [[h'aI]]\nbusy 002 [[b'Izi]]\nfree 003 [[fr'i:]]\nsmalltalk 004 [[sm'O:ltO:k]]\n\nAfter modifying generate.sh from the spoken command repo (eliminating some\nextra commands and extending the loop to generating more samples) I had\neverything I needed to synthetically generate a new labeled word dataset.\n#!/bin/bash\n# For the various loops the variable stored in the index variable\n# is used to attenuate the voices being created from espeak.\n\nlastwordid=\"\"\n\ncat words | while read word wordid phoneme\n\ndo\n    echo $word\n    mkdir -p db/$word\n\n    if [[ $word != $lastword ]]; then\n        versionid=0\n    fi\n\n    lastword=$word\n\n    # Generate voices with various dialects\n    for i in english english-north en-scottish english_rp english_wmids english-us en-westindies\n    do\n        # Loop changing the pitch in each iteration\n        for k in $(seq 1 99)\n        do\n            # Change the speed of words per minute\n            for j in 80 100 120 140 160; do\n                echo $versionid \"$phoneme\" $i $j $k\n                echo \"$phoneme\" | espeak -p $k -s $j -v $i -w db/$word/$versionid.wav\n                # Set sox options for Tensorflow\n                sox db/$word/$versionid.wav -b 16 --endian little db/$word/tf_$versionid.wav rate 16k\n                ((versionid++))\n            done\n        done\n    done\ndone\n\nAfter the run I have samples and labels with a volume comparable to the other\nwords provided by Google. The pitch, speed and tone of voice changes with each\nloop which will hopefully provide enough variety to make this dataset useful in\ntraining. Even if this doesn't work out learning about espeak and sox was\ninteresting. I've already got some future ideas on how to use those. If it does\nwork the ability to generate training data on demand seems incredibly useful.\nNext up, training the model and loading to the ESP-EYE.

Seeing an esp board I went that route since I've heard alot from the\nmaker/hacker community and thought it would be a good opportunity to learn more.\nAdditionally it's been quite a while since I had a project that was primarily\nC/C++ so that was exciting. Like any good project I ran into multiple\nunexpected bumps, bugs and issues. Some were minor, others were frustrating. I'm\ncapturing some of those here for anybody else that may be starting down the path\nof using Tensorflow Lite and an ESP32 board.\nTensorflow speed bumps\nGetting started with TF Lite is easy enough, but something I noticed as I\ncontinued to work on the project is just how little things are designed specific\nto the platform. Instead the examples are setup with Arduino as a default, and\nthen work is done to make that run on X target. In the case of the ESP-EYE\nthis looks like packing everything into an Arduino compatible loop, and handling\nthat in a single FreeRTOS task. I get the reason for this, but it's also a bit\nof a headache later on as it feels like an anti pattern when addin in new task\nand event handlers.\nAnother bump you are likely to notice is that the TF Lite examples rely on\nfunctionality present in the TF 1.x branch for training, but require TF\n&gt;= 2.2 for micro libs. Not the end of the world, but it means your going to\nmanage multiple environts. If managing this using venv/virtualenv keep in\nmind you're going to need the esp-idf requirements in the 2.x environment, or\njust install in both as you may find yourself switching back and forth. In\naddition to python lib versions the examples note esp-idf 4.0, but you will\nwant to use &gt;=4.0 with this\ncommit or you will run into compiler failures. I ended up using 4.1\neventually, but something to note.\nFinally interaction with the model feels flaky. It's an example so this kind of\nmakes sense, but I found that while the word detected was pretty accurate the\nnew_command and some of the attributes of the keyword being provided by the\nmodel weren't matching my expectation/use. I ended up using the score value\nand monitoring the model to setup the conditionals for responding to commands in\nmy application.\nOverall the examples are great to have, and walking you through the train, test\nand load cycle is really helpful. The main thing I wish I had known was that the\nTF Arduino path for ESP was pretty much the same as the ESP native path with\nregards to utility and functionality just using the esp-idf toolchain.\nESP speed bumps\nFrom the ESP side of things the core idf tooling is nice. I like how open it\nis and how much I can understand the different pieces. This helped a few times\nwhen I ran into unexpected behavior. One thing to note is if you follow the\ndocumented path of cloning esp-idf you will want to consider how you manage\nthe release branch you use and when you merge updates. Updates are not pushed\ninto minor/bug fix branches instead they go into the release branch targeted on\nmerge.\nBeing new to the esp platform something I didn't know when I got started was\nthat esp-idf 4.x\nreleased in February of 2020. Because of this alot of the documentation and\nexamples such as ESP-WHO and\nesp-skainet are still based on\n3.x which has a variety of differences and changes in things like\nthe TCP/network stack. Because of this checking the version used in various\ndocs, examples etc is (as usual) important. Since the TF examples reference\nversion 4 that's where I started, but a lot of what's out there is based on v3.\nOne other bump somebody may run into is struct initialization in a modern\ntoolchain when calling the underlying esp C libraries from C++. I spent some\ntime digging around after transitioning the http request example into the TF C++\ncommand_responder code and the compiler told me I was missing uninitialized\nstruct fields and their order made them required.\nThe example code:\nesp_http_client_config_t config = {\n        .url = \"http://httpbin.org/get\",\n        .event_handler = _http_event_handler,\n        .user_data = local_response_buffer,\n};\nesp_http_client_handle_t client = esp_http_client_init(&amp;config);\nesp_err_t err = esp_http_client_perform(client);\n\nAnd how I had to do it in C++:\nesp_http_client_config_t* config = (esp_http_client_config_t*)calloc(sizeof(esp_http_client_config_t), 1);\nconfig-&gt;url = URL;\nconfig-&gt;cert_pem = burningdaylight_io_root_cert_pem_start;\nconfig-&gt;event_handler = _http_event_handler;\n\nesp_http_client_handle_t client = esp_http_client_init(config);\nesp_http_client_set_method(client, HTTP_METHOD_PUT);\nesp_err_t err = esp_http_client_perform(client);\n\nI had a similar issue with wifi and you can see the solution\nhere.\nI really enjoyed my lite trip into idf. It's an interesting set of components\nand followed a workflow that I use and appreciate. I wrote a couple aliases\nthat somebody might find useful:\nalias adf=\"export ADF_PATH=$HOME/projects/esp-adf\"\nalias idf-refresh=\"rm -rf $HOME/projects/esp-idf &amp;&amp; git clone --recursive git@github.com:espressif/esp-idf.git $HOME/projects/esp-idf &amp;&amp; $HOME/projects/esp-idf/install.sh\"\nalias idf=\". $HOME/projects/esp-idf/export.sh\"\nalias idf3=\"pushd $HOME/projects/esp-idf &amp;&amp; git checkout release/v3.3 &amp;&amp; popd &amp;&amp; . $HOME/projects/esp-idf/export.sh\"\nalias idf4x=\"pushd $HOME/projects/esp-idf &amp;&amp; git checkout release/v4.0 &amp;&amp; popd &amp;&amp; . $HOME/projects/esp-idf/export.sh\"\nalias idf4=\"pushd $HOME/projects/esp-idf &amp;&amp; git checkout release/v4.1 &amp;&amp; popd &amp;&amp; . $HOME/projects/esp-idf/export.sh\"\nalias idf-test=\"idf.py --port /dev/cu.SLAB_USBtoUART flash monitor\"\n\nAnd I look forward to writing more about esp as I continue to use it in new\nprojects.\nApproaching the end of this project it's been a larger undertaking than I\nexpected, but I've learned a lot. It's definitely generated a few new project\nideas. The code, docs, images etc for the project can be found\nhere and I'll be posting updates as I\ncontinue along to HackadayIO and\nthis blog.

Last\nyear I spent a few weeks playing with the portal to make a badge at Gen Con and\nhad a lot of fun with it. Since that time\nCircuitPython 5 has been released and\nthe portal now expects a few new modules\nwhich were easy enough to download and send to the board. The PyPortal makes it\nincredibly easy to point at an endpoint to fetch data:\nimport board\nfrom adafruit_pyportal import PyPortal\n\npyportal = PyPortal(\n    url=&lt;your url here&gt;,\n    default_bg=\"green.bmp\"\n)\n\nstatus = pyportal.fetch()\nprint(status)\n\nWith that small snippet we have our status, and all we need to do is put that\nin a loop to set the background depending on the bit returned.\nimport board\nfrom time import sleep\nfrom adafruit_pyportal import PyPortal\n\ntry:\n    from secrets import secrets  # noqa\nexcept ImportError:\n    print(\"WiFi secrets are kept in secrets.py, please add them there!\")\n    raise\n\npyportal = PyPortal(\n    url=secrets[\"signal\"],\n    default_bg=\"green.bmp\"\n)\n\ncurrent = 0\n\nwhile True:\n    status = int(pyportal.fetch())\n    if status == 0 and status == current:\n        pass\n    elif status == 0 and status != current:\n        pyportal.set_background(\"green.bmp\")\n        current = 0\n    elif status == 1 and status != current:\n        pyportal.set_background(\"red.bmp\")\n        current = 1\n    elif status == 1 and status == current:\n        pass\n    sleep(30)\n\nEven though it's a small snippet I want to point out a couple things. First I'm\nwrapping the return from fetch in a cast to int. If you use Python,  but you\nare new to CircuitPython this may seem odd. If you don't do this and try to\ncompare a string to an int you're probably not going to get the result you\nexpect. Try it out in a repl and then follow up with\nCircuitPython Essentials\n. Also I'm only changing the background if the status we fetch is different than\nthe current status. While repainting the screen is fast, it's noticeable and\nthere's no reason to do it every 30 seconds if nothing is different.\nThat's it. Now whenever the endpoint receives an update the portal will see\nthat status change and update the display.\n\n\nThanks to Adafruit for publishing the\ncase above.\nThe logo on display is the Jolly Wrencher of\nHackaday.\nWith the endpoint and display done\nI'm off into the unknown. I'll be setting up the ESP-EYE to update the endpoint,\ntraining the voice model and finally running it all with FreeRTOS.\nThe code, docs, images etc for the project can be found\nhere and I'll be posting updates as I\ncontinue along to HackadayIO and\nthis blog.

I was able to achieve what I was hoping to along the way. I learned\nmore about model development, tensorflow and esp. While this version has some\ndistinct differences from what I outlined for the logic flow (keywords, VAD) it\nachieves the functional goal. The code, docs, images etc for the project can be\nfound in this repo, and the project details\nlive on HackadayIO. When I get back\nto this project and work on v1.x I'll make updates available to each.\n\n\nA couple thoughts having worked through this in the evening for a couple months:\n\nI really should have outlined the states that the esp program was going to\ncycle through, and then mapped those into task on the FreeRTOS event loop. While\nthe high level flow captures the external systems behavior the esp has the most\nmoving parts at the applications level, and is where most of the state is\ninfluenced.\nI want to spend some more time with C++ 14/17 understanding the gotchas of\ninterfacing with C99. I ran into a few different struct init issues and found a\nfew ways to solve them. I'm sure there is a good reason for different solutions,\nbut it's not something I've spent a lot of time dealing with so I need to learn.\nWhile continuing to learn about esp-idf I want to look into some of the esp\nhal work too. I briefly explored esp-adf and skainet while working through\non-air. Both focus on a couple boards but seems to have functionality that\nwould be interesting for a variety of devices. Understanding the HAL and\ncomponents better seems to be where to start.\nData, specifically structured data is going to continue to be a large barrier\nfor open models and for anybody to be able to train a model for their own\nwant/need.

Too many times I got so caught up in writing\ncode, or just getting one more thing done that by the time I did that getting\nmyself to do a thorough write up of issues I experienced, interesting findings,\nor even successful moments was difficult. I know that I put this off sometimes,\nand different parts of the project are not as well documented, or details have\nbeen lost to the days in between.\nThere's a lot of fun stuff left to explore here I can see why I've heard a lot\nabout esp and look forward to building more.\n\n","id":"https://burningdaylight.io/posts/train-all-the-things-finished/","title":"Train All the Things - Wrapping Up"},"https://burningdaylight.io/posts/train-all-the-things-planning/":{"body":"Earlier this year Hackaday announced the\nTrain all the Things\ncontest. I immediately knew I wanted to submit something, but figuring out what\nto build took me a little bit. For my side projects I like to make something\nthat is useful to me, or somebody I know; while also learning something new. A\nfew days after the contest was announced my daughter was in the basement\nplaying outside my office/homelab when I remembered my wife had asked me if\nthere was a way for her to know when I was working with somebody so that they\ncould avoid coming down in the basement. I thought a voice driven display could\nbe a fun solution.\nChoosing Tools\nAfter deciding on the project the next thing I wanted to figure out was what\nnew boards I would need (if any) and how I would build my model. After doing\nsome research I landed on\nTensorflow as my path\nforward for deploying a model to a microcontroller. Having used Tensorflow the\nbarrier for model creation is a bit lower, but I am really curious about\nTensorflow Lite and the potential it provides. Additionally a relatively new\nbook TinyML looks like a good resource to use along\nthe way.\nAfter settling on TF Lite the next thing was picking a board. Most of my\nembedded experience has been with CircuitPython and Rust. For this project I\nthought it would be fun to learn something new. The Espressif ESP-EYE caught my\neye as an interesting board known to work with TF Lite. I've seen the ESP32 and\n8266 in a lot of other projects, so learning the ESP toolchain seems valuable.\nAdditionally a lot of the Espressif ecosystem seems to be built around FreeRTOS\nwhich provides a whole other avenue of learning and hacking.\nFinally I will need a way to let somebody know when the model has picked up\nvoice activity, to signal that I'm currently busy in the lab. The ESP32 has a\nWiFi chip providing the ability to send and receive signals via TCP if we want.\nThe ESP-EYE has that built in, and I happend to have a PyPortal (with an ESP32)\nthat could make a great display checking for a status using WiFi too. To signal\nfrom one to the other I decided to have some fun and use Cloudflare Workers K/V\nto set a bit from the ESP-EYE that would be read by the PyPortal at a given time\ninterval to set the display.\nPutting it all together the initial idea looks something like this:\n\nWhich allows me to have a small board in my homelab listening and the display\nabove the stairwell where somebody can get a status update before they ever\ncome down.\nThe code, docs, images etc for the project can be found\nhere and I'll be posting updates as I\ncontinue along to HackadayIO and\nthis blog.

To create this standard abstraction ODBC has two components, the driver\nand the driver manager.\nODBC Driver\nWithin ODBC the driver encapsulates the functionality needed to map various\nfunctions to underlying system calls. This functionality spans calls to connect,\nquery, disconnect and more depending on what the target data source provides.\nWhile almost all drivers provide the prior basic interactivity others many\nexpose more advanced functionality like concurrent cursors, query translation,\nencryption and more. It's worth reviewing your ODBC driver docs to see what\nfeatures you might use specific to your data source. While ODBC provides a\nuseful abstraction for connecting to data sources it's worth using whatever\nadditional functionality is available to make your application perform it's\nbest and keep your data secure on the wire.\nODBC Driver Manager\nOk so the ODBC driver encapsulates the functionality for interacting with our\ndata source what do we need a driver manager for? First it's not uncommon that\nyou may want your application to interact with various different data sources\nof the same type. When this happens the driver manager provides the management\nand concept of the DSN. The DSN (data source name) contains the information\nrequired to connect to the data source (host, port, user etc for more\ninformation checkout connection strings\nsince the driver manager can save these to a name you specify. This way you can\nhave one driver (for instance Postgres or Elasticsearch) that can be used to\nconnect to various different data sources from the same vendor. In addition to\nthis the driver manager is responsible for keeping up with what drivers are\navailable on the system and exposing that information to applications. By\nknowing what drivers and DSNs are available the driver manager can sit in\nbetween your application and the ODBC driver making sure the connection\ninformation and data passed back and forth is mapped to the right system and\nthat return calls from the driver get mapped back for use by applications.\nNext Up\nLast up in post 3 I plan on exploring ODBC from the application layer to the\ndriver layer with Python and pyodbc looking to trace internals and see exactly\nhow and where different layers connect.\nContact\nIf you have experience with ODBC internals, want to correct something I've\nwritten or just want to reach out feel free to follow up via\nemail or on\n.\nI also have a repo with the material\nI used for a presentation on this at the\nLouisville DerbyPy meetup in March of 2019.\n","id":"https://burningdaylight.io/posts/what-is-odbc-pt2/","title":"What is ODBC Part 2 of 3"},"https://burningdaylight.io/posts/what-is-odbc-pt3/":{"body":"For more information see part one and\npart two\nSetting Up\nJust like any other piece of software we can make use of debuggers to step\nthrough our application code and see what is happening with ODBC. To do this\nwith Python you should be running a version with debug symbols included. You\ncan do this via:\ngit clone git@github.com:python/cpython.git\nmkdir debug\ncd debug\n../configure --with-pydebug\nmake\nmake test\n\nAdditionally you will want to clone pyodbc so that we can make use of symbols.\ngit clone git@github.com:mkleehammer/pyodbc.git\nCFLAGS='-Wall -O0 -g' python setup.py build\n\nFinally you'll need some code and a database to interact with. If you want I\nhave an example repo which uses\ndocker to start Postgres and/or MSSQL. It also contains some python\nexample code and pyodbc in the repo for debugging.\nOne final note, if you wish to explore code all the way into the driver manager\nand/or driver you will need a debug version of each. For Mac and Linux you can\ndo this with unixodbc found here or\nhere and specify debug with make\nsimilar to CPython above. For a debug driver build checkout\nPostgres psqlodbc.\nStepping through\nI'm writing this on OSX, but the concepts are the same regardless of platform.\nOn OSX you can use LLDB or GDB (I used LLDB as a learning exercise), on Linux\nGDB is probably your go to and on Windows you can use WinGDB or the debugger\nbuilt into Visual Studio for C/C++.\nFrom the command line start your debugger, or if using GDB/LLDB call your tool\nwith the -f flag specifying you want to load a file and call Python with your\ndebugger so the Python interpreter will run the file inside your debugger.\nlldb -f python -- -m pdb main.py\n\nFrom here you can execute the application, use normal step, thread and frame\nfunctions to inspect the stack at different steps or get additional dump file\ninformation.

We did this because we interacted with 5 different\nrelational databases, and not all of them had native driver libraries for\nPython. In addition to this our use of pyodbc meant that we had a nice\nconsistent database API for on-boarding, or when somebody needed to interact\nwith a database that might be new to them for their project. Recently though\nI had somebody ask me what ODBC was, and to be honest I didn't have a good\nanswer. I've used ODBC libraries in multiple languages, but I hadn't really\ndug into the nuts and bolts of what it was because I hadn't needed to. I knew\nenough to use it, it worked well and there were bigger problems to solve. It's\na good question though. What is ODBC?\nAt a high level ODBC (Open Database Connectivity) is a specification for a\ndatabase API creating a standard way for applications to interact with various\ndatabases via a series of translation and application layers. It is independent\nof any specific database, language or operating system. The specification lays\nout a series of functions that expose database functionality across systems.\nIt's an interesting, and I would say fairly successful abstraction since many\nprogrammers know how to connect, query and process data (via ODBC) in their\nlanguage, but maybe they have never read sql.h or the SQLBrowseConnect\nfunction. For the full API Reference check\nhere.\nAPI vs Protocol\nQuick side note. You may have heard about wire protocols and databases. ODBC is\nnot a protocol; it is an API. This is important because databases tend to\ndefine their own wire protocols (some share this now with things like the\nPostgres wire protocol being OSS) that dictate the sequence in which events or\nbytes must happen for communication to work. ODBC as an API doesn't dictate\nthis kind of detail, instead it describes how to expose the database\nfunctionality to the programmer consistently independent of the database.\nAPI: describes all valid functionality and interactions\nProtocol: defines the sequence of operations and bytes.\nWhy ODBC\nIf databases define their own protocols and have their own way of communicating\nwhy should we worry about ODBC? Turns out there are a\nlot of databases you\ncan use. Factor in an explosion of languages and operating systems and suddenly\nyou have as many developers writing low level wrappers for database drivers as\nyou do building your actual product. Instead ODBC provides a standard for\ndatabase developers to expose functionality without developers having to\nreinvent new bindings for each new language, database, operating system\ncombination. You can read more\nhere\nNext Up\nNow that we know ODBC is an API I want to look at the architecture of ODBC. In\nmy next post I will cover the driver manager, ODBC drivers and the ODBC API.\nAfter that I plan on exploring ODBC from the application layer through the\ndriver layer with Python and pyodbc looking to trace internals and see exactly\nhow and where different layers connect.\nContact\nIf you have experience with ODBC internals, want to correct something I've\nwritten or just want to reach out feel free to follow up via\nemail or on\n.\nI also have a repo with the material\nI used for a presentation on this at the\nLouisville DerbyPy meetup in March of 2019.\n","id":"https://burningdaylight.io/posts/what-is-odbc/","title":"What is ODBC Part 1 of 3"},"https://burningdaylight.io/posts/wildcard-letsencrypt/":{"body":"This is out of date, I have since switched to self hosting gitea and AWS.\nA few months ago I decided to migrate my Pelican site from Github to Gitlab.\nThis was motivated largely by that fact that Gitlab has CI/CD built in by\ndefault. During this migration I also decided it was time to setup my own\nSSL certificate for burningdaylight.io. Since this\nwas new I looked around to see if there was any documentation readily available\n, and I found\nthis\nwonderful tutorial from Fedora Magazine.\nBetween that and the Gitlab\ncustom domain and ssl\nI was able to get up and running pretty quickly. I had accomplished my goals:\n\nmigrate to Gitlab\nsetup CI/CD of the Pelican site project\nsetup ssl\n\nGood to go, done in an afternoon with plenty of time to work on a new post.\nI thought.\nAbout a week later I was on a different computer and instead of browsing to\nhttps://burningdaylight.io I went to https://www.burningdaylight.io and Firefox\nblocked my request citing an SSL certificate error. Wondering what I had done\nwrong I started tracing back through what I had done and realized that I had\nonly setup SSL certificate for my primary domain. Luckily last year lets\nencrypt added support for\nwildcard\ncertificates to certbot. Unfortunately that has not been included in a\nrelease\nso there's a couple steps that differ from the original Fedora article above.\nSetup Instructions\nBelow are the steps to use certbot, gitlab pages and your domain management\nconsole to setup SSL for your subdomains. This assumes you are using a Debian\nbased OS (I'm using Ubuntu 18.04) to install Certbot. If not swap out the\ncertbot install steps for your OS and continue.\nIf you read the Fedora article linked above you do not need another key in\n.well-known. Instead for your subdomain you will validate with certbot by a\nDNS record setup via your Domain Management Console.\nsudo aptget install certbot\ncertbot certonly -a manual -d *.&lt;yourdomainhere&gt;.&lt;topleveldomainhere&gt; \\\n--config-dir ~/letsencrypt/config --work-dir ~/letsencrypt/work \\\n--logs-dir ~/letsencrypt/logs \\\n--server https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory\n\nFollow the instructions entering your email, reviewing ToS, etc\nYou will then see this prompt:\nPlease deploy a DNS TXT record under the name\n_acme-challenge.burningdaylight.io with the following value:\n\nLogin to your domain management console and setup a txt record similar to:\nNAMETYPETTLVALUE\n_acme-challengeTXT1800your code from the terminal prompt above\n\nOnce you have this setup it's a good idea to wait a couple minutes since this\nrecord will populate via DNS and then return to your console and hit enter.\nOnce certbot validates the TXT record is available as part of your domain it\nwill provide you the new location of your fullchain.pem and privkey.pem\nfiles for use with Gitlab pages.\nWith these files ready to go browse to your Gitlab page settings and setup your\nsubdomains as documented here and\nhere.\nI highly recommend reading the Gitlab documentation above, but to summarize:\n\nIn your Gitlab pages project settings click add a new site\nEnter the url\nAdd the data from your fullchain.pem and privkey.pem files generated via\ncertbot\nCopy the gitlab-pages-verfication-code= section from the Gitlab validation\nrecord box\nLogin to your domain management console\nSetup a new TXT record for your subdomain:\n\nNAMETYPETTLVALUE\nWWWTXT1800gitlab-pages-verification-code=\n\n\nSetup a new A record for\n\nGitlab\nNAMETYPETTLVALUE\nWWWA180035.185.44.232\n\n\nReturn to your Gitlab Pages settings console and click the verify button.\n\nWrapping Up\nWith that you pages should show green and verified. If you browse to the\ndifferent subdomains you setup then you should get through without any SSL\nproblems.\nOne thing to note is that you will need to renew your certbot certificate\nevery 90 days. This is done via the certbot renew command. I've setup an\nAirflow dag to take care of this since I have Airflow managing various other\nthings for me. You can see that here\nHopefully you find the above helpful. If you run into issues I recommend:\n\nMake sure you used the * wildcard in the domain cert setup\nSetup your _acme-challenge record correctly in your domain management console\nand left it there\nSetup the right TXT and A records for Gitlab\n\n","id":"https://burningdaylight.io/posts/wildcard-letsencrypt/","title":"Subdomain SSL with Gitlab Pages"},"https://burningdaylight.io/posts/zero-truth/":{"body":"A couple weeks ago I had the opportunity to attend the\nSICP course\ntaught by David Beazley.
